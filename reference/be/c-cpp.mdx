## cc_binary

<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/starlark/builtins_bzl/common/cc/cc_binary.bzl" class="button button-with-icon" target="_blank">View rule source<span class="material-icons icon-after" aria-hidden="true">open_in_new</span></a>

``` rule-signature
cc_binary(name, deps, srcs, data, additional_linker_inputs, args, aspect_hints, compatible_with, conlyopts, copts, cxxopts, defines, deprecation, distribs, dynamic_deps, env, exec_compatible_with, exec_group_compatible_with, exec_properties, features, hdrs_check, includes, licenses, link_extra_lib, linkopts, linkshared, linkstatic, local_defines, malloc, module_interfaces, nocopts, output_licenses, package_metadata, reexport_deps, restricted_to, stamp, tags, target_compatible_with, testonly, toolchains, visibility, win_def_file)
```

It produces an executable binary.

  
The `name` of the target should be the same as the name of the
source file that is the main entry point of the application (minus the extension).
For example, if your entry point is in `main.cc`, then your name should
be `main`.

#### Implicit output targets

- `name``.stripped` (only built if explicitly requested): A stripped
  version of the binary. `strip -g` is run on the binary to remove debug
  symbols. Additional strip options can be provided on the command line using
  `--stripopt=-foo`.
- `name``.dwp` (only built if explicitly requested): If
  [Fission](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFission) is enabled: a debug
  information package file suitable for debugging remotely deployed binaries. Else: an
  empty file.

<p>These can be <code>cc_library</code> or <code>objc_library</code>
targets.</p>

<a href="#cc_binary.linkopts">linkopts</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td id="cc_binary.srcs"><code>srcs</code></td>
<td><p>List of <a href="/concepts/labels">labels</a>; default is <code>[]</code></p>
The list of C and C++ files that are processed to create the library target.
These are C/C++ source and header files, either non-generated (normal source
code) or generated.
<p>All <code>.cc</code>, <code>.c</code>, and <code>.cpp</code> files will
be compiled. These might be generated files: if a named file is in
the <code>outs</code> of some other rule, this <code>cc_library</code>
will automatically depend on that other rule.</p>
<p>Pure assembler files (.s, .asm) are not preprocessed and are typically built using
the assembler. Preprocessed assembly files (.S) are preprocessed and are typically built
using the C/C++ compiler.</p>
<p>A <code>.h</code> file will not be compiled, but will be available for
inclusion by sources in this rule. Both <code>.cc</code> and
<code>.h</code> files can directly include headers listed in
these <code>srcs</code> or in the <code>hdrs</code> of this rule or any
rule listed in the <code>deps</code> argument.</p>
<p>All <code>#include</code>d files must be mentioned in the
<code>hdrs</code> attribute of this or referenced <code>cc_library</code>
rules, or they should be listed in <code>srcs</code> if they are private
to this library. See <a href="#hdrs">"Header inclusion checking"</a> for
a more detailed description.</p>
<p><code>.so</code>, <code>.lo</code>, and <code>.a</code> files are
pre-compiled files. Your library might have these as
<code>srcs</code> if it uses third-party code for which we don't
have source code.</p>
<p>If the <code>srcs</code> attribute includes the label of another rule,
<code>cc_library</code> will use the output files of that rule as source files to
compile. This is useful for one-off generation of source code (for more than occasional
use, it's better to implement a Starlark rule class and use the <code>cc_common</code>
API)</p>
<p>Permitted <code>srcs</code> file types:</p>
<ul>
<li>C and C++ source files: <code>.c</code>, <code>.cc</code>, <code>.cpp</code>,
<code>.cxx</code>, <code>.c++</code>, <code>.C</code></li>
<li>C and C++ header files: <code>.h</code>, <code>.hh</code>, <code>.hpp</code>,
<code>.hxx</code>, <code>.inc</code>, <code>.inl</code>, <code>.H</code></li>
<li>Assembler with C preprocessor: <code>.S</code></li>
<li>Archive: <code>.a</code>, <code>.pic.a</code></li>
<li>"Always link" library: <code>.lo</code>, <code>.pic.lo</code></li>
<li>Shared library, versioned or unversioned: <code>.so</code>,
<code>.so.</code><em><code>version</code></em></li>
<li>Object file: <code>.o</code>, <code>.pic.o</code></li>
</ul>
<p>... and any rules that produce those files (e.g. <code>cc_embed_data</code>).
Different extensions denote different programming languages in
accordance with gcc convention.</p></td>

<tr>
<td id="cc_binary.data"><code>data</code></td>
<td><p>List of <a href="/concepts/labels">labels</a>; default is <code>[]</code></p>
The list of files needed by this library at runtime.
See general comments about <code>data</code>
at <a href="/reference/be/common-definitions#typical-attributes">Typical attributes defined by

<p>If a <code>data</code> is the name of a generated file, then this
<code>cc_library</code> rule automatically depends on the generating

<p>If a <code>data</code> is a rule name, then this
<code>cc_library</code> rule automatically depends on that rule,

<p>Each string in this attribute is added in the given order to <code>COPTS</code> before

Each string, which must consist of a single Bourne shell token,
is prepended with <code>-D</code> and added to the compile command line to this target,
as well as to every rule that depends on it. Be very careful, since this may have
far-reaching effects. When in doubt, add define values to

<p>The <code>cc_shared_library</code> implementation will use the list of
<code>dynamic_deps</code> (transitively, i.e. also the <code>dynamic_deps</code> of the
current target's <code>dynamic_deps</code>) to decide which <code>cc_libraries</code> in
the transitive <code>deps</code> should not be linked in because they are already provided

Each string is prepended with the package path and passed to the C++ toolchain for
expansion via the "include_paths" CROSSTOOL feature. A toolchain running on a POSIX system
with typical feature definitions will produce
<code>-isystem path_to_package/include_entry</code>.
This should only be used for third-party libraries that
do not conform to the Google style of writing #include statements.
Unlike <a href="#cc_binary.copts">COPTS</a>, these flags are added for this rule
and every rule that depends on it. (Note: not the rules it depends upon!) Be
very careful, since this may have far-reaching effects. When in doubt, add
"-I" flags to <a href="#cc_binary.copts">COPTS</a> instead.
<p>The added <code>include</code> paths will include generated files as well as

<td id="cc_binary.link_extra_lib"><code>link_extra_lib</code></td>

Control linking of extra libraries.
<p>By default, C++ binaries are linked against <code>//tools/cpp:link_extra_lib</code>,
which by default depends on the label flag <code>//tools/cpp:link_extra_libs</code>.
Without setting the flag, this library is empty by default. Setting the label flag
allows linking optional dependencies, such as overrides for weak symbols, interceptors
for shared library functions, or special runtime libraries (for malloc replacements,
prefer <code>malloc</code> or <code>--custom_malloc</code>). Setting this attribute to
<code>None</code> disables this behaviour.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td id="cc_binary.linkopts"><code>linkopts</code></td>
<td><p>List of strings; default is <code>[]</code></p>
Add these flags to the C++ linker command.
Subject to <a href="make-variables.html">"Make" variable</a> substitution,
<a href="common-definitions.html#sh-tokenization">Bourne shell tokenization</a> and
<a href="common-definitions.html#label-expansion">label expansion</a>.
Each string in this attribute is added to <code>LINKOPTS</code> before
linking the binary target.
<p>Each element of this list that does not start with <code>$</code> or <code>-</code> is
assumed to be the label of a target in <code>deps</code>. The
list of files generated by that target is appended to the linker
options. An error is reported if the label is invalid, or is
not declared in <code>deps</code>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td id="cc_binary.linkshared"><code>linkshared</code></td>
<td><p>Boolean; default is <code>False</code></p>
Create a shared library.
To enable this attribute, include <code>linkshared=True</code> in your rule. By default
this option is off.
<p>The presence of this flag means that linking occurs with the <code>-shared</code> flag
to <code>gcc</code>, and the resulting shared library is suitable for loading into for
example a Java program. However, for build purposes it will never be linked into the
dependent binary, as it is assumed that shared libraries built with a
<a href="#cc_binary">cc_binary</a> rule are only loaded manually by other programs, so
it should not be considered a substitute for the <a href="#cc_library">cc_library</a>
rule. For sake of scalability we recommend avoiding this approach altogether and
simply letting <code>java_library</code> depend on <code>cc_library</code> rules
instead.</p>
<p>If you specify both <code>linkopts=['-static']</code> and <code>linkshared=True</code>,
you get a single completely self-contained unit. If you specify both
<code>linkstatic=True</code> and <code>linkshared=True</code>, you get a single, mostly
self-contained unit.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td id="cc_binary.linkstatic"><code>linkstatic</code></td>
<td><p>Boolean; default is <code>True</code></p>
For <a href="/reference/be/c-cpp.html#cc_binary"><code>cc_binary</code></a> and
<a href="/reference/be/c-cpp.html#cc_test"><code>cc_test</code></a>: link the binary in static
mode. For <code>cc_library.link_static</code>: see below.
<p>By default this option is on for <code>cc_binary</code> and off for the rest.</p>
<p>If enabled and this is a binary or test, this option tells the build tool to link in
<code>.a</code>'s instead of <code>.so</code>'s for user libraries whenever possible.
System libraries such as libc (but <em>not</em> the C/C++ runtime libraries,
see below) are still linked dynamically, as are libraries for which
there is no static library. So the resulting executable will still be dynamically
linked, hence only <em>mostly</em> static.</p>
<p>There are really three different ways to link an executable:</p>
<ul>
<li>STATIC with fully_static_link feature, in which everything is linked statically;
e.g. "<code>gcc -static foo.o libbar.a libbaz.a -lm</code>".<br />
This mode is enabled by specifying <code>fully_static_link</code> in the
<a href="/reference/be/common-definitions#features"><code>features</code></a> attribute.</li>
<li>STATIC, in which all user libraries are linked statically (if a static
version is available), but where system libraries (excluding C/C++ runtime libraries)
are linked dynamically, e.g. "<code>gcc foo.o libfoo.a libbaz.a -lm</code>".<br />
This mode is enabled by specifying <code>linkstatic=True</code>.</li>
<li>DYNAMIC, in which all libraries are linked dynamically (if a dynamic version is
available), e.g. "<code>gcc foo.o libfoo.so libbaz.so -lm</code>".<br />
This mode is enabled by specifying <code>linkstatic=False</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>linkstatic</code> attribute or <code>fully_static_link</code> in
<code>features</code> is used outside of <code>//third_party</code>
please include a comment near the rule to explain why.</p>
<p>The <code>linkstatic</code> attribute has a different meaning if used on a
<a href="/reference/be/c-cpp.html#cc_library"><code>cc_library()</code></a> rule.
For a C++ library, <code>linkstatic=True</code> indicates that only
static linking is allowed, so no <code>.so</code> will be produced. linkstatic=False does
not prevent static libraries from being created. The attribute is meant to control the
creation of dynamic libraries.</p>
<p>There should be very little code built with <code>linkstatic=False</code> in production.
If <code>linkstatic=False</code>, then the build tool will create symlinks to
depended-upon shared libraries in the <code>*.runfiles</code> area.</p></td>

which is an empty library so the binary ends up using libc malloc.

## cc_import

<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/starlark/builtins_bzl/common/cc/cc_import.bzl" class="button button-with-icon" target="_blank">View rule source<span class="material-icons icon-after" aria-hidden="true">open_in_new</span></a>

``` rule-signature
cc_import(name, deps, data, hdrs, alwayslink, aspect_hints, compatible_with, deprecation, exec_compatible_with, exec_group_compatible_with, exec_properties, features, includes, interface_library, linkopts, objects, package_metadata, pic_objects, pic_static_library, restricted_to, shared_library, static_library, strip_include_prefix, system_provided, tags, target_compatible_with, testonly, toolchains, visibility)
```

`cc_import` rules allows users to import precompiled C/C++ libraries.

The following are the typical use cases:  
1. Linking a static library

``` lang-starlark

cc_import(
  name = "mylib",
  hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
  static_library = "libmylib.a",
  # If alwayslink is turned on,
  # libmylib.a will be forcely linked into any binary that depends on it.
  # alwayslink = 1,
)
```

2\. Linking a shared library (Unix)

``` lang-starlark

cc_import(
  name = "mylib",
  hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
  shared_library = "libmylib.so",
)
```

3\. Linking a shared library with interface library

On Unix:

``` lang-starlark

cc_import(
  name = "mylib",
  hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
  # libmylib.ifso is an interface library for libmylib.so which will be passed to linker
  interface_library = "libmylib.ifso",
  # libmylib.so will be available for runtime
  shared_library = "libmylib.so",
)
```

On Windows:

``` lang-starlark

cc_import(
  name = "mylib",
  hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
  # mylib.lib is an import library for mylib.dll which will be passed to linker
  interface_library = "mylib.lib",
  # mylib.dll will be available for runtime
  shared_library = "mylib.dll",
)
```

4\. Linking a shared library with `system_provided=True`

On Unix:

``` lang-starlark

cc_import(
  name = "mylib",
  hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
  interface_library = "libmylib.ifso", # Or we can also use libmylib.so as its own interface library
  # libmylib.so is provided by system environment, for example it can be found in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
  # This indicates that Bazel is not responsible for making libmylib.so available.
  system_provided = 1,
)
```

On Windows:

``` lang-starlark

cc_import(
  name = "mylib",
  hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
  # mylib.lib is an import library for mylib.dll which will be passed to linker
  interface_library = "mylib.lib",
  # mylib.dll is provided by system environment, for example it can be found in PATH.
  # This indicates that Bazel is not responsible for making mylib.dll available.
  system_provided = 1,
)
```

5\. Linking to static or shared library

On Unix:

``` lang-starlark

cc_import(
  name = "mylib",
  hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
  static_library = "libmylib.a",
  shared_library = "libmylib.so",
)
```

On Windows:

``` lang-starlark

cc_import(
  name = "mylib",
  hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
  static_library = "libmylib.lib", # A normal static library
  interface_library = "mylib.lib", # An import library for mylib.dll
  shared_library = "mylib.dll",
)
```

The remaining is the same on Unix and Windows:

``` lang-starlark

# first will link to libmylib.a (or libmylib.lib)
cc_binary(
  name = "first",
  srcs = ["first.cc"],
  deps = [":mylib"],
  linkstatic = 1, # default value
)

# second will link to libmylib.so (or libmylib.lib)
cc_binary(
  name = "second",
  srcs = ["second.cc"],
  deps = [":mylib"],
  linkstatic = 0,
)
```

`cc_import` supports an include attribute. For example:

``` lang-starlark

cc_import(
  name = "curl_lib",
  hdrs = glob(["vendor/curl/include/curl/*.h"]),
  includes = ["vendor/curl/include"],
  shared_library = "vendor/curl/lib/.libs/libcurl.dylib",
)
```

## cc_library

<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/starlark/builtins_bzl/common/cc/cc_library.bzl" class="button button-with-icon" target="_blank">View rule source<span class="material-icons icon-after" aria-hidden="true">open_in_new</span></a>

``` rule-signature
cc_library(name, deps, srcs, data, hdrs, additional_compiler_inputs, additional_linker_inputs, alwayslink, aspect_hints, compatible_with, conlyopts, copts, cxxopts, defines, deprecation, exec_compatible_with, exec_group_compatible_with, exec_properties, features, hdrs_check, implementation_deps, include_prefix, includes, licenses, linkopts, linkstamp, linkstatic, local_defines, module_interfaces, package_metadata, restricted_to, strip_include_prefix, tags, target_compatible_with, testonly, textual_hdrs, toolchains, visibility, win_def_file)
```

Use `cc_library()` for C++-compiled libraries.
The result is either a `.so`, `.lo`,
or `.a`, depending on what is needed.

If you build something with static linking that depends on
a `cc_library`, the output of a depended-on library rule
is the `.a` file. If you specify
`alwayslink=True`, you get the `.lo` file.

The actual output file name is `lib`*`foo`*`.so` for
the shared library, where *foo* is the name of the rule. The
other kinds of libraries end with `.lo` and `.a`,
respectively. If you need a specific shared library name, for
example, to define a Python module, use a genrule to copy the library
to the desired name.

#### Header inclusion checking

All header files that are used in the build must be declared in
the `hdrs` or `srcs` of `cc_*` rules.
This is enforced.

For `cc_library` rules, headers in `hdrs` comprise the
public interface of the library and can be directly included both
from the files in `hdrs` and `srcs` of the library
itself as well as from files in `hdrs` and `srcs`
of `cc_*` rules that list the library in their `deps`.
Headers in `srcs` must only be directly included from the files
in `hdrs` and `srcs` of the library itself. When
deciding whether to put a header into `hdrs` or `srcs`,
you should ask whether you want consumers of this library to be able to
directly include it. This is roughly the same decision as
between `public` and `private` visibility in programming languages.

`cc_binary` and `cc_test` rules do not have an exported
interface, so they also do not have a `hdrs` attribute. All headers
that belong to the binary or test directly should be listed in
the `srcs`.

To illustrate these rules, look at the following example.

``` lang-starlark

cc_binary(
    name = "foo",
    srcs = [
        "foo.cc",
        "foo.h",
    ],
    deps = [":bar"],
)

cc_library(
    name = "bar",
    srcs = [
        "bar.cc",
        "bar-impl.h",
    ],
    hdrs = ["bar.h"],
    deps = [":baz"],
)

cc_library(
    name = "baz",
    srcs = [
        "baz.cc",
        "baz-impl.h",
    ],
    hdrs = ["baz.h"],
)
```

The allowed direct inclusions in this example are listed in the table below.
For example `foo.cc` is allowed to directly
include `foo.h` and `bar.h`, but not `baz.h`.

| Including file | Allowed inclusions     |
|----------------|------------------------|
| foo.h          | bar.h                  |
| foo.cc         | foo.h bar.h            |
| bar.h          | bar-impl.h baz.h       |
| bar-impl.h     | bar.h baz.h            |
| bar.cc         | bar.h bar-impl.h baz.h |
| baz.h          | baz-impl.h             |
| baz-impl.h     | baz.h                  |
| baz.cc         | baz.h baz-impl.h       |

The inclusion checking rules only apply to *direct*
inclusions. In the example above `foo.cc` is allowed to
include `bar.h`, which may include `baz.h`, which in
turn is allowed to include `baz-impl.h`. Technically, the
compilation of a `.cc` file may transitively include any header
file in the `hdrs` or `srcs` in
any `cc_library` in the transitive `deps` closure. In
this case the compiler may read `baz.h` and `baz-impl.h`
when compiling `foo.cc`, but `foo.cc` must not
contain `#include "baz.h"`. For that to be
allowed, `baz` must be added to the `deps`
of `foo`.

Bazel depends on toolchain support to enforce the inclusion checking rules.
The `layering_check` feature has to be supported by the toolchain
and requested explicitly, for example via the
`--features=layering_check` command-line flag or the
`features` parameter of the
[`package`](/reference/be/functions.html#package) function. The toolchains
provided by Bazel only support this feature with clang on Unix and macOS.

#### Examples

We use the `alwayslink` flag to force the linker to link in
this code although the main binary code doesn't reference it.

``` lang-starlark

cc_library(
    name = "ast_inspector_lib",
    srcs = ["ast_inspector_lib.cc"],
    hdrs = ["ast_inspector_lib.h"],
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
    deps = ["//third_party/llvm/llvm/tools/clang:frontend"],
    # alwayslink as we want to be able to call things in this library at
    # debug time, even if they aren't used anywhere in the code.
    alwayslink = 1,
)
```

The following example comes from
`third_party/python2_4_3/BUILD`.
Some of the code uses the `dl` library (to load
another, dynamic library), so this
rule specifies the `-ldl` link option to link the
`dl` library.

``` lang-starlark

cc_library(
    name = "python2_4_3",
    linkopts = [
        "-ldl",
        "-lutil",
    ],
    deps = ["//third_party/expat"],
)
```

The following example comes from `third_party/kde/BUILD`.
We keep pre-built `.so` files in the depot.
The header files live in a subdirectory named `include`.

``` lang-starlark

cc_library(
    name = "kde",
    srcs = [
        "lib/libDCOP.so",
        "lib/libkdesu.so",
        "lib/libkhtml.so",
        "lib/libkparts.so",
        ...more .so files...,
    ],
    includes = ["include"],
    deps = ["//third_party/X11"],
)
```

The following example comes from `third_party/gles/BUILD`.
Third-party code often needs some `defines` and
`linkopts`.

``` lang-starlark

cc_library(
    name = "gles",
    srcs = [
        "GLES/egl.h",
        "GLES/gl.h",
        "ddx.c",
        "egl.c",
    ],
    defines = [
        "USE_FLOAT",
        "__GL_FLOAT",
        "__GL_COMMON",
    ],
    linkopts = ["-ldl"],  # uses dlopen(), dl library
    deps = [
        "es",
        "//third_party/X11",
    ],
)
```

The <code>linkopts</code> attribute is also applied to any target that

the <a href="/reference/be/c-cpp.html#cc_binary.malloc"><code>malloc</code></a>

linkopts take precedence over dependent linkopts (i.e. dependency linkopts
appear later in the command line). Linkopts specified in
<a href="../user-manual.html#flag--linkopt"><code>--linkopt</code></a>
take precedence over rule linkopts.
<p>Note that the <code>linkopts</code> attribute only applies
when creating <code>.so</code> files or executables, not
when creating <code>.a</code> or <code>.lo</code> files.
So if the <code>linkstatic=True</code> attribute is set, the

## cc_shared_library

``` rule-signature
cc_shared_library(name, deps, additional_linker_inputs, aspect_hints, compatible_with, deprecation, dynamic_deps, exec_compatible_with, exec_group_compatible_with, exec_properties, experimental_disable_topo_sort_do_not_use_remove_before_7_0, exports_filter, features, package_metadata, restricted_to, roots, shared_lib_name, static_deps, tags, target_compatible_with, testonly, toolchains, user_link_flags, visibility, win_def_file)
```

It produces a shared library.

#### Example

``` code

cc_shared_library(
    name = "foo_shared",
    deps = [
        ":foo",
    ],
    dynamic_deps = [
        ":bar_shared",
    ],
    additional_linker_inputs = [
        ":foo.lds",
    ],
    user_link_flags = [
        "-Wl,--version-script=$(location :foo.lds)",
    ],
)
cc_library(
    name = "foo",
    srcs = ["foo.cc"],
    hdrs = ["foo.h"],
    deps = [
        ":bar",
        ":baz",
    ],
)
cc_shared_library(
    name = "bar_shared",
    shared_lib_name = "bar.so",
    deps = [":bar"],
)
cc_library(
    name = "bar",
    srcs = ["bar.cc"],
    hdrs = ["bar.h"],
)
cc_library(
    name = "baz",
    srcs = ["baz.cc"],
    hdrs = ["baz.h"],
)
```

In the example `foo_shared` statically links `foo`
and `baz`, the latter being a transitive dependency. It doesn't
link `bar` because it is already provided dynamically by the
`dynamic_dep` `bar_shared`.

`foo_shared` uses a linker script \*.lds file to control which
symbols should be exported. The `cc_shared_library` rule logic does
not control which symbols get exported, it only uses what is assumed to be
exported to give errors during analysis phase if two shared libraries export the
same targets.

Every direct dependency of `cc_shared_library` is assumed to be
exported. Therefore, Bazel assumes during analysis that `foo` is being
exported by `foo_shared`. `baz` is not assumed to be exported
by `foo_shared`. Every target matched by the `exports_filter`
is also assumed to be exported.

Every single `cc_library` in the example should appear at most in one
`cc_shared_library`. If we wanted to link `baz` also into
`bar_shared` we would need to add
`tags = ["LINKABLE_MORE_THAN_ONCE"]` to `baz`.

Due to the `shared_lib_name` attribute, the file produced by
`bar_shared` will have the name `bar.so` as opposed
to the name `libbar.so` that it would have by default on Linux.

#### Errors

##### `Two shared libraries in dependencies export the same symbols.`

This will happen whenever you are creating a target with two different
`cc_shared_library` dependencies that export the same target. To fix this
you need to stop the libraries from being exported in one of the
`cc_shared_library` dependencies.

##### `Two shared libraries in dependencies link the same library statically`

This will happen whenever you are creating a new `cc_shared_library` with two
different `cc_shared_library` dependencies that link the same target statically.
Similar to the error with exports.

One way to fix this is to stop linking the library into one of the
`cc_shared_library` dependencies. At the same time, the one that still links it
needs to export the library so that the one not linking it keeps visibility to
the symbols. Another way is to pull out a third library that exports the target.
A third way is to tag the culprit `cc_library` with `LINKABLE_MORE_THAN_ONCE`
but this fix should be rare and you should absolutely make sure that the
`cc_library` is indeed safe to link more than once.

##### `` '//foo:foo' is already linked statically in '//bar:bar' but not exported` ``

This means that a library in the transitive closure of your `deps` is reachable
without going through one of the `cc_shared_library` dependencies but is already
linked into a different `cc_shared_library` in `dynamic_deps` and is not
exported.

The solution is to export it from the `cc_shared_library` dependency or pull out
a third `cc_shared_library` that exports it.

##### `Do not place libraries which only contain a precompiled dynamic library in deps. `

If you have a precompiled dynamic library, this doesn't need to and cannot be
linked statically into the current `cc_shared_library` target that you are
currently creating. Therefore, it doesn't belong in `deps` of the
`cc_shared_library`. If this precompiled dynamic library is a dependency of one
of your `cc_libraries`, then the `cc_library` needs to depend on it
directly.

##### `Trying to export a library already exported by a different shared library`

You will see this error if on the current rule you are claiming to export a
target that is already being exported by one of your dynamic dependencies.

To fix this, remove the target from `deps` and just rely on it from the dynamic
dependency or make sure that the `exports_filter` doesn't catch this target.

cc_static_library(name, deps, aspect_hints, compatible_with, deprecation, exec_compatible_with, exec_group_compatible_with, exec_properties, features, package_metadata, restricted_to, tags, target_compatible_with, testonly, toolchains, visibility)
```

Produces a static library from a list of targets and their transitive dependencies.

The resulting static library contains the object files of the targets listed in
`deps` as well as their transitive dependencies, with preference given to
`PIC` objects.

#### Output groups

##### `linkdeps`

A text file containing the labels of those transitive dependencies of targets listed in
`deps` that did not contribute any object files to the static library, but do
provide at least one static, dynamic or interface library. The resulting static library
may require these libraries to be available at link time.

##### `linkopts`

A text file containing the user-provided `linkopts` of all transitive
dependencies of targets listed in `deps`.

#### Duplicate symbols

By default, the `cc_static_library` rule checks that the resulting static
library does not contain any duplicate symbols. If it does, the build fails with an error
message that lists the duplicate symbols and the object files containing them.

This check can be disabled per target or per package by setting
`features = ["-symbol_check"]` or globally via
`--features=-symbol_check`.

##### Toolchain support for `symbol_check`

The auto-configured C++ toolchains shipped with Bazel support the
`symbol_check` feature on all platforms. Custom toolchains can add support for
it in one of two ways:

- Implementing the `ACTION_NAMES.validate_static_library` action and
  enabling it with the `symbol_check` feature. The tool set in the action is
  invoked with two arguments, the static library to check for duplicate symbols and the
  path of a file that must be created if the check passes.
- Having the `symbol_check` feature add archiver flags that cause the
  action creating the static library to fail on duplicate symbols.

## cc_test

<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/starlark/builtins_bzl/common/cc/cc_test.bzl" class="button button-with-icon" target="_blank">View rule source<span class="material-icons icon-after" aria-hidden="true">open_in_new</span></a>

```

A `cc_test()` rule compiles a test. Here, a test
is a binary wrapper around some testing code.

*By default, C++ tests are dynamically linked.*  
To statically link a unit test, specify
[`linkstatic=True`](/reference/be/c-cpp.html#cc_binary.linkstatic).
It would probably be good to comment why your test needs
`linkstatic`; this is probably not obvious.

#### Implicit output targets

- `name``.stripped` (only built if explicitly requested): A stripped
  version of the binary. `strip -g` is run on the binary to remove debug
  symbols. Additional strip options can be provided on the command line using
  `--stripopt=-foo`.
- `name``.dwp` (only built if explicitly requested): If
  [Fission](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFission) is enabled: a debug
  information package file suitable for debugging remotely deployed binaries. Else: an
  empty file.

See the [cc_binary()](/reference/be/c-cpp.html#cc_binary_args) arguments, except that
the `stamp` argument is set to 0 by default for tests and
that `cc_test` has extra
[attributes common to all test rules (\*\_test)](/reference/be/common-definitions#common-attributes-tests).

Create a shared library.
To enable this attribute, include <code>linkshared=True</code> in your rule. By default
this option is off.
<p>The presence of this flag means that linking occurs with the <code>-shared</code> flag
to <code>gcc</code>, and the resulting shared library is suitable for loading into for
example a Java program. However, for build purposes it will never be linked into the
dependent binary, as it is assumed that shared libraries built with a
<a href="#cc_binary">cc_binary</a> rule are only loaded manually by other programs, so
it should not be considered a substitute for the <a href="#cc_library">cc_library</a>
rule. For sake of scalability we recommend avoiding this approach altogether and
simply letting <code>java_library</code> depend on <code>cc_library</code> rules
instead.</p>
<p>If you specify both <code>linkopts=['-static']</code> and <code>linkshared=True</code>,
you get a single completely self-contained unit. If you specify both

mode. For <code>cc_library.link_static</code>: see below.
<p>By default this option is on for <code>cc_binary</code> and off for the rest.</p>
<p>If enabled and this is a binary or test, this option tells the build tool to link in
<code>.a</code>'s instead of <code>.so</code>'s for user libraries whenever possible.
System libraries such as libc (but <em>not</em> the C/C++ runtime libraries,
see below) are still linked dynamically, as are libraries for which
there is no static library. So the resulting executable will still be dynamically
linked, hence only <em>mostly</em> static.</p>
<p>There are really three different ways to link an executable:</p>
<ul>
<li>STATIC with fully_static_link feature, in which everything is linked statically;
e.g. "<code>gcc -static foo.o libbar.a libbaz.a -lm</code>".<br />
This mode is enabled by specifying <code>fully_static_link</code> in the
<a href="/reference/be/common-definitions#features"><code>features</code></a> attribute.</li>
<li>STATIC, in which all user libraries are linked statically (if a static
version is available), but where system libraries (excluding C/C++ runtime libraries)
are linked dynamically, e.g. "<code>gcc foo.o libfoo.a libbaz.a -lm</code>".<br />
This mode is enabled by specifying <code>linkstatic=True</code>.</li>
<li>DYNAMIC, in which all libraries are linked dynamically (if a dynamic version is
available), e.g. "<code>gcc foo.o libfoo.so libbaz.so -lm</code>".<br />
This mode is enabled by specifying <code>linkstatic=False</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>linkstatic</code> attribute or <code>fully_static_link</code> in
<code>features</code> is used outside of <code>//third_party</code>
please include a comment near the rule to explain why.</p>
<p>The <code>linkstatic</code> attribute has a different meaning if used on a
<a href="/reference/be/c-cpp.html#cc_library"><code>cc_library()</code></a> rule.
For a C++ library, <code>linkstatic=True</code> indicates that only
static linking is allowed, so no <code>.so</code> will be produced. linkstatic=False does
not prevent static libraries from being created. The attribute is meant to control the
creation of dynamic libraries.</p>
<p>There should be very little code built with <code>linkstatic=False</code> in production.
If <code>linkstatic=False</code>, then the build tool will create symlinks to
depended-upon shared libraries in the <code>*.runfiles</code> area.</p></td>

``` rule-signature
cc_toolchain(name, all_files, ar_files, as_files, aspect_hints, compatible_with, compiler_files, compiler_files_without_includes, coverage_files, deprecation, dwp_files, dynamic_runtime_lib, exec_compatible_with, exec_group_compatible_with, exec_properties, exec_transition_for_inputs, features, libc_top, licenses, linker_files, module_map, objcopy_files, output_licenses, package_metadata, restricted_to, static_runtime_lib, strip_files, supports_header_parsing, supports_param_files, tags, target_compatible_with, testonly, toolchain_config, toolchain_identifier, toolchains, visibility)
```

Represents a C++ toolchain.

This rule is responsible for:

- Collecting all artifacts needed for C++ actions to run. This is done by
  attributes such as `all_files`, `compiler_files`,
  `linker_files`, or other attributes ending with `_files`). These are
  most commonly filegroups globbing all required files.
- Generating correct command lines for C++ actions. This is done using
  `CcToolchainConfigInfo` provider (details below).

Use `toolchain_config` attribute to configure the C++ toolchain.
See also this
[page](https://bazel.build/docs/cc-toolchain-config-reference)
for elaborate C++ toolchain configuration and toolchain selection documentation.

Use `tags = ["manual"]` in order to prevent toolchains from being built and configured
unnecessarily when invoking `bazel build //...`
