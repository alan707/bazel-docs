# Platforms and Toolchains Rules

{% dynamic setvar source_file "src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/docgen/templates/be/rules.vm" %}
{% include "\_buttons.html" %}

This set of rules exists to allow you to model specific hardware platforms you are
building for and specify the specific tools you may need to compile code for those platforms.
The user should be familiar with the concepts explained [here](/extending/platforms).

## Rules

- [constraint_setting](#constraint_setting)
- [constraint_value](#constraint_value)
- [platform](#platform)
- [toolchain](#toolchain)
- [toolchain_type](#toolchain_type)

## constraint_setting

<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/platform/ConstraintSettingRule.java" class="button button-with-icon" target="_blank">View rule source<span class="material-icons icon-after" aria-hidden="true">open_in_new</span></a>

``` rule-signature
constraint_setting(name, aspect_hints, default_constraint_value, deprecation, features, licenses, tags, testonly, visibility)
```

This rule is used to introduce a new constraint type for which a platform may specify a value.
For instance, you might define a `constraint_setting` named "glibc_version" to represent
the capability for platforms to have different versions of the glibc library installed.
For more details, see the
[Platforms](https://bazel.build/docs/platforms) page.

Each `constraint_setting` has an extensible set of associated
`constraint_value`s. Usually these are defined in the same package, but sometimes a
different package will introduce new values for an existing setting. For instance, the predefined
setting `@platforms//cpu:cpu` can be extended with a custom value in order to
define a platform targeting an obscure cpu architecture.

### Arguments

<table class="table table-condensed table-bordered table-params">
<thead>
<tr>
<th colspan="2">Attributes</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td id="constraint_setting.name"><code>name</code></td>
<td><p><a href="/concepts/labels#target-names">Name</a>; required</p>
<p>A unique name for this target.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td id="constraint_setting.default_constraint_value"><code>default_constraint_value</code></td>
<td><p><a href="/concepts/labels#target-names">Name</a>; <a href="common-definitions.html#configurable-attributes">nonconfigurable</a>; default is <code>None</code></p>
The label of the default value for this setting, to be used if no value is given. If this
attribute is present, the <code>constraint_value</code> it points to must be defined in the
same package as this <code>constraint_setting</code>.
<p>If a constraint setting has a default value, then whenever a platform does not include
any constraint value for that setting, it is the same as if the platform had specified the
default value. Otherwise, if there is no default value, the constraint setting is considered
to be unspecified by that platform. In that case, the platform would not match against any
constraint list (such as for a <code>config_setting</code>) that requires a particular value
for that setting.</p></td>

## constraint_value

<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/platform/ConstraintValueRule.java" class="button button-with-icon" target="_blank">View rule source<span class="material-icons icon-after" aria-hidden="true">open_in_new</span></a>

``` rule-signature
constraint_value(name, aspect_hints, constraint_setting, deprecation, features, licenses, tags, testonly, visibility)
```

This rule introduces a new value for a given constraint type.
For more details, see the
[Platforms](https://bazel.build/docs/platforms) page.

#### Example

The following creates a new possible value for the predefined `constraint_value`
representing cpu architecture.

``` code

constraint_value(
    name = "mips",
    constraint_setting = "@platforms//cpu:cpu",
)
```

Platforms can then declare that they have the `mips` architecture as an alternative to
`x86_64`, `arm`, and so on.

## platform

<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/platform/PlatformRule.java" class="button button-with-icon" target="_blank">View rule source<span class="material-icons icon-after" aria-hidden="true">open_in_new</span></a>

``` rule-signature
platform(name, aspect_hints, constraint_values, deprecation, exec_properties, features, flags, licenses, missing_toolchain_error, parents, remote_execution_properties, required_settings, tags, testonly, visibility)
```

This rule defines a new platform -- a named collection of constraint choices
(such as cpu architecture or compiler version) describing an environment in
which part of the build may run.
For more details, see the [Platforms](/extending/platforms) page.

#### Example

This defines a platform that describes any environment running Linux on ARM.

``` code

platform(
    name = "linux_arm",
    constraint_values = [
        "@platforms//os:linux",
        "@platforms//cpu:arm",
    ],
)
```

### Platform Flags

Platforms may use the `flags` attribute to specify a list of flags that will be added
to the configuration whenever the platform is used as the target platform (i.e., as the value of
the `--platforms` flag).

Flags set from the platform effectively have the highest precedence and overwrite any previous
value for that flag, from the command line, rc file, or transition.

#### Example

``` code

platform(
    name = "foo",
    flags = [
        "--dynamic_mode=fully",
        "--//bool_flag",
        "--no//package:other_bool_flag",
    ],
)
```

This defines a platform named `foo`. When this is the target platform (either because
the user specified `--platforms//:foo`, because a transition set the
`//command_line_option:platforms` flag to `["//:foo"]`, or because
`//:foo` was used as an execution platform), then the given flags will be set in the
configuration.

#### Platforms and Repeatable Flags

Some flags will accumulate values when they are repeated, such as `--features`,
`--copt`, any Starlark flag created as `config.string(repeatable = True)`.
These flags are not compatible with setting the flags from the platform: instead, all previous
values will be removed and overwritten with the values from the platform.

As an example, given the following platform, the invocation `build --platforms=//:repeat_demo --features feature_a --features feature_b` will end up with the value of the
`--feature` flag being `["feature_c", "feature_d"]`, removing the features
set on the command line.

``` code

platform(
    name = "repeat_demo",
    flags = [
        "--features=feature_c",
        "--features=feature_d",
    ],
)
```

For this reason, it is discouraged to use repeatable flags in the `flags` attribute.

### Platform Inheritance

Platforms may use the `parents` attribute to specify another platform that they will
inherit constraint values from. Although the `parents` attribute takes a list, no
more than a single value is currently supported, and specifying multiple parents is an error.

When checking for the value of a constraint setting in a platform, first the values directly set
(via the `constraint_values` attribute) are checked, and then the constraint values on
the parent. This continues recursively up the chain of parent platforms. In this manner, any
values set directly on a platform will override the values set on the parent.

Platforms inherit the `exec_properties` attribute from the parent platform.
The dictionary entries in `exec_properties` of the parent and child platforms
will be combined.
If the same key appears in both the parent's and the child's `exec_properties`,
the child's value will be used. If the child platform specifies an empty string as a value, the
corresponding property will be unset.

Platforms can also inherit the (deprecated) `remote_execution_properties` attribute
from the parent platform. Note: new code should use `exec_properties` instead. The
logic described below is maintained to be compatible with legacy behavior but will be removed
in the future.
The logic for setting the `remote_execution_platform` is as follows when there
is a parent platform:

1.  If `remote_execution_property` is not set on the child platform, the parent's
    `remote_execution_properties` will be used.
2.  If `remote_execution_property` is set on the child platform, and contains the
    literal string {PARENT_REMOTE_EXECUTION_PROPERTIES}, that macro will be
    replaced with the contents of the parent's `remote_execution_property` attribute.
3.  If `remote_execution_property` is set on the child platform, and does not contain
    the macro, the child's `remote_execution_property` will be used unchanged.

*Since `remote_execution_properties` is deprecated and will be phased out, mixing
`remote_execution_properties` and `exec_properties` in the same
inheritance chain is not allowed.*
Prefer to use `exec_properties` over the deprecated
`remote_execution_properties`.

#### Example: Constraint Values

``` code

platform(
    name = "parent",
    constraint_values = [
        "@platforms//os:linux",
        "@platforms//cpu:arm",
    ],
)
platform(
    name = "child_a",
    parents = [":parent"],
    constraint_values = [
        "@platforms//cpu:x86_64",
    ],
)
platform(
    name = "child_b",
    parents = [":parent"],
)
```

In this example, the child platforms have the following properties:

- `child_a` has the constraint values `@platforms//os:linux` (inherited
  from the parent) and `@platforms//cpu:x86_64` (set directly on the platform).
- `child_b` inherits all constraint values from the parent, and doesn't set any of
  its own.

#### Example: Execution properties

``` code

platform(
    name = "parent",
    exec_properties = {
      "k1": "v1",
      "k2": "v2",
    },
)
platform(
    name = "child_a",
    parents = [":parent"],
)
platform(
    name = "child_b",
    parents = [":parent"],
    exec_properties = {
      "k1": "child"
    }
)
platform(
    name = "child_c",
    parents = [":parent"],
    exec_properties = {
      "k1": ""
    }
)
platform(
    name = "child_d",
    parents = [":parent"],
    exec_properties = {
      "k3": "v3"
    }
)
```

In this example, the child platforms have the following properties:

- `child_a` inherits the "exec_properties" of the parent and does not set its own.
- `child_b` inherits the parent's `exec_properties` and overrides the
  value of `k1`. Its `exec_properties` will be:
  `{ "k1": "child", "k2": "v2" }`.
- `child_c` inherits the parent's `exec_properties` and unsets
  `k1`. Its `exec_properties` will be:
  `{ "k2": "v2" }`.
- `child_d` inherits the parent's `exec_properties` and adds a new
  property. Its `exec_properties` will be:
  `{ "k1": "v1", "k2": "v2", "k3": "v3" }`.

``` rule-signature
toolchain_type(name, aspect_hints, compatible_with, deprecation, features, no_match_error, package_metadata, restricted_to, tags, target_compatible_with, testonly, visibility)
```

This rule defines a new type of toolchain -- a simple target that represents a class of tools that
serve the same role for different platforms.

See the [Toolchains](/docs/toolchains) page for more details.

#### Example

This defines a toolchain type for a custom rule.

``` code

toolchain_type(
    name = "bar_toolchain_type",
)
```

This can be used in a bzl file.

``` code

bar_binary = rule(
    implementation = _bar_binary_impl,
    attrs = {
        "srcs": attr.label_list(allow_files = True),
        ...
        # No `_compiler` attribute anymore.
    },
    toolchains = ["//bar_tools:toolchain_type"]
