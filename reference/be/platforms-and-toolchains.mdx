title: 'Platforms and Toolchains Rules'
---



This set of rules exists to allow you to model specific hardware platforms you are
building for and specify the specific tools you may need to compile code for those platforms.
The user should be familiar with the concepts explained [here](/extending/platforms).

## Rules

- [constraint\_setting](#constraint_setting)
- [constraint\_value](#constraint_value)
- [platform](#platform)
- [toolchain](#toolchain)
- [toolchain\_type](#toolchain_type)

## constraint\_setting

[View rule sourceopen\_in\_new](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/platform/ConstraintSettingRule.java)

```
constraint_setting(name, aspect_hints, default_constraint_value, deprecation, features, licenses, tags, testonly, visibility)
```

This rule is used to introduce a new constraint type for which a platform may specify a value.
For instance, you might define a `constraint_setting` named "glibc\_version" to represent
the capability for platforms to have different versions of the glibc library installed.

For more details, see the
[Platforms](https://bazel.build/docs/platforms) page.

Each `constraint_setting` has an extensible set of associated
`constraint_value` s. Usually these are defined in the same package, but sometimes a
different package will introduce new values for an existing setting. For instance, the predefined
setting `@platforms//cpu:cpu` can be extended with a custom value in order to
define a platform targeting an obscure cpu architecture.



### Arguments

Attributes`name`

[Name](/concepts/labels#target-names); required

A unique name for this target.

`default_constraint_value`

[Name](/concepts/labels#target-names); [nonconfigurable](common-definitions.html#configurable-attributes); default is `None`

 The label of the default value for this setting, to be used if no value is given. If this
 attribute is present, the `constraint_value` it points to must be defined in the
 same package as this `constraint_setting`.



If a constraint setting has a default value, then whenever a platform does not include
any constraint value for that setting, it is the same as if the platform had specified the
default value. Otherwise, if there is no default value, the constraint setting is considered
to be unspecified by that platform. In that case, the platform would not match against any
constraint list (such as for a `config_setting`) that requires a particular value
for that setting.



## constraint\_value

[View rule sourceopen\_in\_new](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/platform/ConstraintValueRule.java)

```
constraint_value(name, aspect_hints, constraint_setting, deprecation, features, licenses, tags, testonly, visibility)
```

This rule introduces a new value for a given constraint type.

For more details, see the
[Platforms](https://bazel.build/docs/platforms) page.

#### Example

The following creates a new possible value for the predefined `constraint_value`
representing cpu architecture.

```
constraint_value(
    name = "mips",
    constraint_setting = "@platforms//cpu:cpu",
)

```

Platforms can then declare that they have the `mips` architecture as an alternative to
`x86_64`, `arm`, and so on.



### Arguments

Attributes`name`

[Name](/concepts/labels#target-names); required

A unique name for this target.

`constraint_setting`

[Label](/concepts/labels); [nonconfigurable](common-definitions.html#configurable-attributes); required

 The `constraint_setting` for which this `constraint_value` is a
 possible choice.



## platform

[View rule sourceopen\_in\_new](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/platform/PlatformRule.java)

```
platform(name, aspect_hints, constraint_values, deprecation, exec_properties, features, flags, licenses, missing_toolchain_error, parents, remote_execution_properties, required_settings, tags, testonly, visibility)
```

This rule defines a new platform -- a named collection of constraint choices
(such as cpu architecture or compiler version) describing an environment in
which part of the build may run.

For more details, see the [Platforms](/extending/platforms) page.

#### Example

This defines a platform that describes any environment running Linux on ARM.

```
platform(
    name = "linux_arm",
    constraint_values = [
        "@platforms//os:linux",
        "@platforms//cpu:arm",
    ],
)

```

### Platform Flags

Platforms may use the `flags` attribute to specify a list of flags that will be added
to the configuration whenever the platform is used as the target platform (i.e., as the value of
the `--platforms` flag).

Flags set from the platform effectively have the highest precedence and overwrite any previous
value for that flag, from the command line, rc file, or transition.

#### Example

```
platform(
    name = "foo",
    flags = [
        "--dynamic_mode=fully",
        "--//bool_flag",
        "--no//package:other_bool_flag",
    ],
)

```

This defines a platform named `foo`. When this is the target platform (either because
the user specified `--platforms//:foo`, because a transition set the
`//command_line_option:platforms` flag to `["//:foo"]`, or because
`//:foo` was used as an execution platform), then the given flags will be set in the
configuration.

#### Platforms and Repeatable Flags

Some flags will accumulate values when they are repeated, such as `--features`,
`--copt`, any Starlark flag created as `config.string(repeatable = True)`.
These flags are not compatible with setting the flags from the platform: instead, all previous
values will be removed and overwritten with the values from the platform.

As an example, given the following platform, the invocation `build --platforms=//:repeat_demo
  --features feature_a --features feature_b` will end up with the value of the
`--feature` flag being `["feature_c", "feature_d"]`, removing the features
set on the command line.

```
platform(
    name = "repeat_demo",
    flags = [
        "--features=feature_c",
        "--features=feature_d",
    ],
)

```

For this reason, it is discouraged to use repeatable flags in the `flags` attribute.

### Platform Inheritance

Platforms may use the `parents` attribute to specify another platform that they will
inherit constraint values from. Although the `parents` attribute takes a list, no
more than a single value is currently supported, and specifying multiple parents is an error.

When checking for the value of a constraint setting in a platform, first the values directly set
(via the `constraint_values` attribute) are checked, and then the constraint values on
the parent. This continues recursively up the chain of parent platforms. In this manner, any
values set directly on a platform will override the values set on the parent.

Platforms inherit the `exec_properties` attribute from the parent platform.
The dictionary entries in `exec_properties` of the parent and child platforms
will be combined.
If the same key appears in both the parent's and the child's `exec_properties`,
the child's value will be used. If the child platform specifies an empty string as a value, the
corresponding property will be unset.

Platforms can also inherit the (deprecated) `remote_execution_properties` attribute
from the parent platform. Note: new code should use `exec_properties` instead. The
logic described below is maintained to be compatible with legacy behavior but will be removed
in the future.

The logic for setting the `remote_execution_platform` is as follows when there
is a parent platform:



1. If `remote_execution_property` is not set on the child platform, the parent's
    `remote_execution_properties` will be used.

2. If `remote_execution_property` is set on the child platform, and contains the
    literal string {PARENT\_REMOTE\_EXECUTION\_PROPERTIES}, that macro will be
    replaced with the contents of the parent's `remote_execution_property` attribute.

3. If `remote_execution_property` is set on the child platform, and does not contain
    the macro, the child's `remote_execution_property` will be used unchanged.


_Since `remote_execution_properties` is deprecated and will be phased out, mixing_
_`remote_execution_properties` and `exec_properties` in the same_
_inheritance chain is not allowed._
Prefer to use `exec_properties` over the deprecated
`remote_execution_properties`.

#### Example: Constraint Values

```
platform(
    name = "parent",
    constraint_values = [
        "@platforms//os:linux",
        "@platforms//cpu:arm",
    ],
)
platform(
    name = "child_a",
    parents = [":parent"],
    constraint_values = [
        "@platforms//cpu:x86_64",
    ],
)
platform(
    name = "child_b",
    parents = [":parent"],
)

```

In this example, the child platforms have the following properties:



- `child_a` has the constraint values `@platforms//os:linux` (inherited
   from the parent) and `@platforms//cpu:x86_64` (set directly on the platform).

- `child_b` inherits all constraint values from the parent, and doesn't set any of
   its own.


#### Example: Execution properties

```
platform(
    name = "parent",
    exec_properties = {
      "k1": "v1",
      "k2": "v2",
    },
)
platform(
    name = "child_a",
    parents = [":parent"],
)
platform(
    name = "child_b",
    parents = [":parent"],
    exec_properties = {
      "k1": "child"
    }
)
platform(
    name = "child_c",
    parents = [":parent"],
    exec_properties = {
      "k1": ""
    }
)
platform(
    name = "child_d",
    parents = [":parent"],
    exec_properties = {
      "k3": "v3"
    }
)

```

In this example, the child platforms have the following properties:



- `child_a` inherits the "exec\_properties" of the parent and does not set its own.

- `child_b` inherits the parent's `exec_properties` and overrides the
   value of `k1`. Its `exec_properties` will be:
   `{ "k1": "child", "k2": "v2" }`.

- `child_c` inherits the parent's `exec_properties` and unsets
   `k1`. Its `exec_properties` will be:
   `{ "k2": "v2" }`.

- `child_d` inherits the parent's `exec_properties` and adds a new
   property. Its `exec_properties` will be:
   `{ "k1": "v1",  "k2": "v2", "k3": "v3" }`.


### Arguments

Attributes`name`

[Name](/concepts/labels#target-names); required

A unique name for this target.

`constraint_values`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); [nonconfigurable](common-definitions.html#configurable-attributes); default is `[]`

 The combination of constraint choices that this platform comprises. In order for a platform
 to apply to a given environment, the environment must have at least the values in this list.



Each `constraint_value` in this list must be for a different
`constraint_setting`. For example, you cannot define a platform that requires the
cpu architecture to be both `@platforms//cpu:x86_64` and
`@platforms//cpu:arm`.



`exec_properties`

Dictionary: String -> String; [nonconfigurable](common-definitions.html#configurable-attributes); default is `{}`

 A map of strings that affect the way actions are executed remotely. Bazel makes no attempt
 to interpret this, it is treated as opaque data that's forwarded via the Platform field of
 the [remote execution protocol](https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis).

 This includes any data from the parent platform's `exec_properties` attributes.
 If the child and parent platform define the same keys, the child's values are kept. Any
 keys associated with a value that is an empty string are removed from the dictionary.

 This attribute is a full replacement for the deprecated
 `remote_execution_properties`.

 `flags`

List of strings; [nonconfigurable](common-definitions.html#configurable-attributes); default is `[]`

 A list of flags that will be enabled when this platform is used as the target platform in
 a configuration. Only flags that are part of the configuration can be set, such as those
 that can be used in transitions, or the `--define` flag.

 `missing_toolchain_error`

String; [nonconfigurable](common-definitions.html#configurable-attributes); default is `"For more information on platforms or toolchains see https://bazel.build/concepts/platforms-intro."`

 A custom error message that is displayed when a mandatory toolchain requirement cannot be satisfied for this target platform. Intended to point to relevant documentation users can read to understand why their toolchains are misconfigured.

 Not inherited from parent platforms.

 `parents`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); [nonconfigurable](common-definitions.html#configurable-attributes); default is `[]`

 The label of a `platform` target that this platform should inherit from. Although
 the attribute takes a list, there should be no more than one platform present. Any
 constraint\_settings not set directly on this platform will be found in the parent platform.
 See the section on [Platform Inheritance](#platform_inheritance) for details.

 `remote_execution_properties`

String; [nonconfigurable](common-definitions.html#configurable-attributes); default is `""`

 DEPRECATED. Please use exec\_properties attribute instead.

 A string used to configure a remote execution platform. Actual builds make no attempt to
 interpret this, it is treated as opaque data that can be used by a specific SpawnRunner.
 This can include data from the parent platform's "remote\_execution\_properties" attribute,
 by using the macro "{PARENT\_REMOTE\_EXECUTION\_PROPERTIES}". See the section on
 [Platform Inheritance](#platform_inheritance) for details.

 `required_settings`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 A list of `config_setting` s that must be satisfied by the target configuration
 in order for this platform to be used as an execution platform during toolchain resolution.

 Required settings are not inherited from parent platforms.



## toolchain

[View rule sourceopen\_in\_new](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/platform/ToolchainRule.java)

```
toolchain(name, aspect_hints, deprecation, exec_compatible_with, features, licenses, package_metadata, tags, target_compatible_with, target_settings, testonly, toolchain, toolchain_type, use_target_platform_constraints, visibility)
```

This rule declares a specific toolchain's type and constraints so that it can be selected
during toolchain resolution. See the
[Toolchains](https://bazel.build/docs/toolchains) page for more
details.



### Arguments

Attributes`name`

[Name](/concepts/labels#target-names); required

A unique name for this target.

`exec_compatible_with`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); [nonconfigurable](common-definitions.html#configurable-attributes); default is `[]`

 A list of `constraint_value` s that must be satisfied by an execution platform in
 order for this toolchain to be selected for a target building on that platform.

 `target_compatible_with`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); [nonconfigurable](common-definitions.html#configurable-attributes); default is `[]`

 A list of `constraint_value` s that must be satisfied by the target platform in
 order for this toolchain to be selected for a target building for that platform.

 `target_settings`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 A list of `config_setting` s that must be satisfied by the target configuration
 in order for this toolchain to be selected during toolchain resolution.

 `toolchain`

[Name](/concepts/labels#target-names); required

 The target representing the actual tool or tool suite that is made available when this
 toolchain is selected.

 `toolchain_type`

[Label](/concepts/labels); [nonconfigurable](common-definitions.html#configurable-attributes); required

 The label of a `toolchain_type` target that represents the role that this
 toolchain serves.

 `use_target_platform_constraints`

Boolean; [nonconfigurable](common-definitions.html#configurable-attributes); default is `False`

 If `True`, this toolchain behaves as if its `exec_compatible_with` and
 `target_compatible_with` constraints are set to those of the current target
 platform. `exec_compatible_with` and `target_compatible_with` must not
 be set in that case.



## toolchain\_type

[View rule sourceopen\_in\_new](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/ToolchainType.java)

```
toolchain_type(name, aspect_hints, compatible_with, deprecation, features, no_match_error, package_metadata, restricted_to, tags, target_compatible_with, testonly, visibility)
```

This rule defines a new type of toolchain -- a simple target that represents a class of tools that
serve the same role for different platforms.

See the [Toolchains](/docs/toolchains) page for more details.

#### Example

This defines a toolchain type for a custom rule.

```
toolchain_type(
    name = "bar_toolchain_type",
)

```

This can be used in a bzl file.

```
bar_binary = rule(
    implementation = _bar_binary_impl,
    attrs = {
        "srcs": attr.label_list(allow_files = True),
        ...
        # No `_compiler` attribute anymore.
    },
    toolchains = ["//bar_tools:toolchain_type"]
)

```

### Arguments

Attributes`name`

[Name](/concepts/labels#target-names); required

A unique name for this target.

`no_match_error`

String; [nonconfigurable](common-definitions.html#configurable-attributes); default is `""`

 A custom error message to display when no matching toolchain is found for this type.
