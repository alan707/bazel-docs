## Rules

- [sh\_binary](#sh-binary)
- [sh\_library](#sh-library)
- [sh\_test](#sh-test)

## sh\_binary

[View rule sourceopen\_in\_new](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_shell/tree/v0.2.0/shell/private/sh_binary.bzl)

```
sh_binary(name, deps, srcs, data, args, aspect_hints, compatible_with, deprecation, env, env_inherit, exec_compatible_with, exec_group_compatible_with, exec_properties, features, output_licenses, package_metadata, restricted_to, tags, target_compatible_with, testonly, toolchains, use_bash_launcher, visibility)
```

The `sh_binary` rule is used to declare executable shell scripts.
( `sh_binary` is a misnomer: its outputs aren't necessarily binaries.) This rule ensures
that all dependencies are built, and appear in the `runfiles` area at execution time.
We recommend that you name your `sh_binary()` rules after the name of the script minus
the extension (e.g. `.sh`); the rule name and the file name must be distinct.
`sh_binary` respects shebangs, so any available interpreter may be used (eg.
`#!/bin/zsh`)

#### Example

For a simple shell script with no dependencies and some data files:

```
sh_binary(
    name = "foo",
    srcs = ["foo.sh"],
    data = glob(["datafiles/*.txt"]),
)

```

### Arguments

Attributes`name`

[Name](/concepts/labels#target-names); required

A unique name for this target.

`deps`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The list of "library" targets to be aggregated into this target.
See general comments about `deps`
at [Typical attributes defined by\
most build rules](/reference/be/common-definitions#typical.deps).

This attribute should be used to list other `sh_library` rules that provide
interpreted program source code depended on by the code in `srcs`. The files
provided by these rules will be present among the `runfiles` of this target.

`srcs`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The file containing the shell script.

This attribute must be a singleton list, whose element is the shell script.
This script must be executable, and may be a source file or a generated file.
All other files required at runtime (whether scripts or data) belong in the
`data` attribute.

`env_inherit`

List of strings; default is `[]`

`use_bash_launcher`

Boolean; default is `False`

 Use a bash launcher initializing the runfiles library


## sh\_library

[View rule sourceopen\_in\_new](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_shell/tree/v0.2.0/shell/private/sh_library.bzl)

```
sh_library(name, deps, srcs, data, aspect_hints, compatible_with, deprecation, exec_compatible_with, exec_group_compatible_with, exec_properties, features, package_metadata, restricted_to, tags, target_compatible_with, testonly, toolchains, visibility)
```

The main use for this rule is to aggregate together a logical
"library" consisting of related scripts—programs in an
interpreted language that does not require compilation or linking,
such as the Bourne shell—and any data those programs need at
run-time. Such "libraries" can then be used from
the `data` attribute of one or
more `sh_binary` rules.

You can use the [`filegroup`](/reference/be/general.html#filegroup) rule to aggregate data
files.

In interpreted programming languages, there's not always a clear
distinction between "code" and "data": after all, the program is
just "data" from the interpreter's point of view. For this reason
this rule has three attributes which are all essentially equivalent:
`srcs`, `deps` and `data`.
The current implementation does not distinguish between the elements of these lists.
All three attributes accept rules, source files and generated files.
It is however good practice to use the attributes for their usual purpose (as with other rules).

#### Examples

```
sh_library(
    name = "foo",
    data = [
        ":foo_service_script",  # an sh_binary with srcs
        ":deploy_foo",  # another sh_binary with srcs
    ],
)

```

### Arguments

Attributes`name`

[Name](/concepts/labels#target-names); required

A unique name for this target.

`deps`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The list of "library" targets to be aggregated into this target.
See general comments about `deps`
at [Typical attributes defined by\
most build rules](/reference/be/common-definitions#typical.deps).

This attribute should be used to list other `sh_library` rules that provide
interpreted program source code depended on by the code in `srcs`. The files
provided by these rules will be present among the `runfiles` of this target.

`srcs`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The list of input files.

This attribute should be used to list shell script source files that belong to
this library. Scripts can load other scripts using the shell's `source`
or `.` command.

## sh\_test

[View rule sourceopen\_in\_new](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_shell/tree/v0.2.0/shell/private/sh_test.bzl)

```
sh_test(name, deps, srcs, data, args, aspect_hints, compatible_with, deprecation, env, env_inherit, exec_compatible_with, exec_group_compatible_with, exec_properties, features, flaky, local, package_metadata, restricted_to, shard_count, size, tags, target_compatible_with, testonly, timeout, toolchains, use_bash_launcher, visibility)
```

A `sh_test()` rule creates a test written as a Bourne shell script.

See the [attributes common to all test rules (\*\_test)](/reference/be/common-definitions#common-attributes-tests).

#### Examples

```
sh_test(
    name = "foo_integration_test",
    size = "small",
    srcs = ["foo_integration_test.sh"],
    deps = [":foo_sh_lib"],
    data = glob(["testdata/*.txt"]),
)

```

### Arguments

`deps`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

at [Typical attributes defined by\

interpreted program source code depended on by the code in `srcs`. The files
provided by these rules will be present among the `runfiles` of this target.

`srcs`

This attribute must be a singleton list, whose element is the shell script.
This script must be executable, and may be a source file or a generated file.

`data` attribute.
