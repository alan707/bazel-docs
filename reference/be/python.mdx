Whether to encode build information into the binary. Possible values:
* `stamp = 1`: Always stamp the build information into the binary, even in
`--nostamp` builds. **This setting should be avoided**, since it potentially kills
remote caching for the binary and any downstream actions that depend on it.
* `stamp = 0`: Always replace build information by constant values. This gives
good build result caching.
* `stamp = -1`: Embedding of build information is controlled by the
`--[no]stamp` flag.
Stamped binaries are not rebuilt unless their dependencies change.
WARNING: Stamping can harm build performance by reducing cache hits and should
be avoided if possible.</td>

**INTERNAL ATTRIBUTE. SHOULD ONLY BE SET BY rules_python-INTERNAL CODE.**
:::{include} /_includes/experimental_api.md
:::
A flag that decides whether the library should treat its sources as a
site-packages layout.
When the flag is `yes`, then the `srcs` files are treated as a site-packages
layout that is relative to the `imports` attribute. The `imports` attribute
can have only a single element. It is a repo-relative runfiles path.
For example, in the `my/pkg/BUILD.bazel` file, given
`srcs=["site-packages/foo/bar.py"]`, specifying
`imports=["my/pkg/site-packages"]` means `foo/bar.py` is the file path
under the binary's venv site-packages directory that should be made available (i.e.
`import foo.bar` will work).
`__init__.py` files are treated specially to provide basic support for [implicit
namespace packages](
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#native-namespace-packages).
However, the *content* of the files cannot be taken into account, merely their
presence or absense. Stated another way: [pkgutil-style namespace packages](
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#pkgutil-style-namespace-packages)
won't be understood as namespace packages; they'll be seen as regular packages. This will
likely lead to conflicts with other targets that contribute to the namespace.

This attributes populates {obj}`PyInfo.site_packages_symlinks`, which is

to a consumer have precedence. See {obj}`PyInfo.site_packages_symlinks` for

How precompiled files should be verified to be up-to-date with their associated
source files. Possible values are:
* `auto`: The effective value will be automatically determined by other build
settings.
* `checked_hash`: Use the pyc file if the hash of the source file matches the hash
recorded in the pyc file. This is most useful when working with code that
you may modify.
* `unchecked_hash`: Always use the pyc file; don't check the pyc's hash against
the source file. This is most useful when the code won't be modified.

The optimization level for precompiled files.
For more information about optimization levels, see the `compile()` function's
`optimize` arg docs at https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile
NOTE: The value `-1` means "current interpreter", which will be the interpreter
used _at build time when pycs are generated_, not the interpreter used at
runtime when the code actually runs.</td>

<tr>
<td id="py_test.precompile_source_retention"><code>precompile_source_retention</code></td>
<td><p>String; default is <code>"inherit"</code></p>
Determines, when a source file is compiled, if the source file is kept
in the resulting output or not. Valid values are:
* `inherit`: Inherit the value from the {flag}`--precompile_source_retention` flag.
* `keep_source`: Include the original Python source.
* `omit_source`: Don't include the original py source.</td>

Determines whether pyc files from dependencies should be manually included.
Valid values are:

* `include_pyc`: Add implicitly generated pyc files from dependencies. i.e.
pyc files for targets that specify {attr}`precompile="inherit"`.
* `disabled`: Don't add implicitly generated pyc files. Note that
pyc files may still come from dependencies that enable precompiling at the

The Python version this target should use.
The value should be in `X.Y` or `X.Y.Z` (or compatible) format. If empty or
unspecified, the incoming configuration's {obj}`--python_version` flag is
inherited. For backwards compatibility, the values `PY2` and `PY3` are
accepted, but treated as an empty/unspecified value.

In order for the requested version to be used, there must be a
toolchain configured to match the Python version. If there isn't, then it
may be silently ignored, or an error may occur, depending on the toolchain

<td><p>Integer; default is <code>0</code></p>
Whether to encode build information into the binary. Possible values:
* `stamp = 1`: Always stamp the build information into the binary, even in
`--nostamp` builds. **This setting should be avoided**, since it potentially kills
remote caching for the binary and any downstream actions that depend on it.
* `stamp = 0`: Always replace build information by constant values. This gives
good build result caching.
* `stamp = -1`: Embedding of build information is controlled by the
`--[no]stamp` flag.
Stamped binaries are not rebuilt unless their dependencies change.
WARNING: Stamping can harm build performance by reducing cache hits and should
be avoided if possible.</td>

py_runtime(name, abi_flags, aspect_hints, bootstrap_template, compatible_with, coverage_tool, deprecation, exec_compatible_with, exec_group_compatible_with, exec_properties, features, files, implementation_name, interpreter, interpreter_path, interpreter_version_info, package_metadata, pyc_tag, python_version, restricted_to, site_init_template, stage2_bootstrap_template, stub_shebang, tags, target_compatible_with, testonly, toolchains, visibility, zip_main_template)
```

Represents a Python runtime used to execute Python code.
A \`py_runtime\` target can represent either a \*platform runtime\* or an \*in-build
runtime\*. A platform runtime accesses a system-installed interpreter at a known
path, whereas an in-build runtime points to an executable target that acts as
the interpreter. In both cases, an "interpreter" means any executable binary or
wrapper script that is capable of running a Python script passed on the command
line, following the same conventions as the standard CPython interpreter.
A platform runtime is by its nature non-hermetic. It imposes a requirement on
the target platform to have an interpreter located at a specific path. An
in-build runtime may or may not be hermetic, depending on whether it points to
a checked-in interpreter or a wrapper script that accesses the system
interpreter.
Example
\`\`\`
load("@rules_python//python:py_runtime.bzl", "py_runtime")
py_runtime(
name = "python-2.7.12",
files = glob(\["python-2.7.12/\*\*"\]),
interpreter = "python-2.7.12/bin/python",
)
py_runtime(
name = "python-3.6.0",
interpreter_path = "/opt/pyenv/versions/3.6.0/bin/python",

<tr>
<td id="py_runtime.bootstrap_template"><code>bootstrap_template</code></td>
<td><p><a href="/concepts/labels">Label</a>; default is <code>"@rules_python//python/private:bootstrap_template"</code></p>
The bootstrap script template file to use. Should have %python_binary%,
%workspace_name%, %main%, and %imports%.
This template, after expansion, becomes the executable file used to start the
process, so it is responsible for initial bootstrapping actions such as finding
the Python interpreter, runfiles, and constructing an environment to run the
intended Python application.
While this attribute is currently optional, it will become required when the
Python rules are moved out of Bazel itself.
The exact variable names expanded is an unstable API and is subject to change.
The API will become more stable when the Python rules are moved out of Bazel
itself.

</tr>
<tr>
<td id="py_runtime.coverage_tool"><code>coverage_tool</code></td>
<td><p><a href="/concepts/labels">Label</a>; default is <code>None</code></p>
This is a target to use for collecting code coverage information from
{rule}`py_binary` and {rule}`py_test` targets.
If set, the target must either produce a single file or be an executable target.
The path to the single file, or the executable if the target is executable,
determines the entry point for the python coverage tool. The target and its
runfiles will be added to the runfiles when coverage is enabled.
The entry point for the tool must be loadable by a Python interpreter (e.g. a
`.py` or `.pyc` file). It must accept the command line arguments
of [`coverage.py`](https://coverage.readthedocs.io), at least including
the `run` and `lcov` subcommands.</td>

<td id="py_runtime.files"><code>files</code></td>
<td><p>List of <a href="/concepts/labels">labels</a>; default is <code>[]</code></p>

<td id="py_runtime.interpreter"><code>interpreter</code></td>
<td><p><a href="/concepts/labels">Label</a>; default is <code>None</code></p>
For an in-build runtime, this is the target to invoke as the interpreter. It
can be either of:
* A single file, which will be the interpreter binary. It's assumed such
interpreters are either self-contained single-file executables or any
supporting files are specified in `files`.
* An executable target. The target's executable will be the interpreter binary.
Any other default outputs (`target.files`) and plain files runfiles
(`runfiles.files`) will be automatically included as if specified in the
`files` attribute.
NOTE: the runfiles of the target may not yet be properly respected/propagated
to consumers of the toolchain/interpreter, see
bazel-contrib/rules_python/issues/1612

Optional string; the tag portion of a pyc filename, e.g. the `cpython-39` infix
of `foo.cpython-39.pyc`. See PEP 3147. If not specified, it will be computed
from `implementation_name` and `interpreter_version_info`. If no pyc_tag is
available, then only source-less pyc generation will function correctly.</td>
