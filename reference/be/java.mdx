## java\_binary

[View rule sourceopen\_in\_new](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_java/blob/master/java/bazel/rules/bazel_java_binary.bzl)

```
java_binary(name, deps, srcs, data, resources, add_exports, add_opens, args, aspect_hints, bootclasspath, classpath_resources, compatible_with, create_executable, deploy_env, deploy_manifest_lines, deprecation, env, exec_compatible_with, exec_group_compatible_with, exec_properties, features, javacopts, jvm_flags, launcher, licenses, main_class, neverlink, output_licenses, package_metadata, plugins, resource_strip_prefix, restricted_to, runtime_deps, stamp, tags, target_compatible_with, testonly, toolchains, use_launcher, use_testrunner, visibility)
```

Builds a Java archive ("jar file"), plus a wrapper shell script with the same name as the rule.
The wrapper shell script uses a classpath that includes, among other things, a jar file for each
library on which the binary depends. When running the wrapper shell script, any nonempty
`JAVABIN` environment variable will take precedence over the version specified via
Bazel's `--java_runtime_version` flag.

The wrapper script accepts several unique flags. Refer to
`java_stub_template.txt`
for a list of configurable flags and environment variables accepted by the wrapper.

#### Implicit output targets

- `name.jar`: A Java archive, containing the class files and other
   resources corresponding to the binary's direct dependencies.
- `name-src.jar`: An archive containing the sources ("source
   jar").
- `name_deploy.jar`: A Java archive suitable for deployment (only
   built if explicitly requested).


   Building the `<name>_deploy.jar` target for your rule
   creates a self-contained jar file with a manifest that allows it to be run with the
   `java -jar` command or with the wrapper script's `--singlejar`
   option. Using the wrapper script is preferred to `java -jar` because it
   also passes the [JVM flags](#java-binary-jvm-flags) and the options
   to load native libraries.



   The deploy jar contains all the classes that would be found by a classloader that
   searched the classpath from the binary's wrapper script from beginning to end. It also
   contains the native libraries needed for dependencies. These are automatically loaded
   into the JVM at runtime.


  If your target specifies a [launcher](#java-binary.launcher)
   attribute, then instead of being a normal JAR file, the \_deploy.jar will be a
   native binary. This will contain the launcher plus any native (C++) dependencies of
   your rule, all linked into a static binary. The actual jar file's bytes will be
   appended to that native binary, creating a single binary blob containing both the
   executable and the Java code. You can execute the resulting jar file directly
   like you would execute any native binary.

- `name_deploy-src.jar`: An archive containing the sources
   collected from the transitive closure of the target. These will match the classes in the
   `deploy.jar` except where jars have no matching source jar.

It is good practice to use the name of the source file that is the main entry point of the
application (minus the extension). For example, if your entry point is called
`Main.java`, then your name could be `Main`.

A `deps` attribute is not allowed in a `java_binary` rule without
[`srcs`](#java-binary-srcs); such a rule requires a
[`main_class`](#java-binary-main-class) provided by
[`runtime_deps`](#java-binary-runtime-deps).

The following code snippet illustrates a common mistake:

```lang-starlark

java_binary(
    name = "DontDoThis",
    srcs = [
        ...,
        "GeneratedJavaFile.java",  # a generated .java file
    ],
    deps = [":generating_rule",],  # rule that generates that file
)

```

Do this instead:

```lang-starlark

java_binary(
    name = "DoThisInstead",
    srcs = [
        ...,
        ":generating_rule",
    ],
)

```

### Arguments

Attributes`name`

[Name](/concepts/labels#target-names); required

A unique name for this target.

`deps`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The list of other libraries to be linked in to the target.
See general comments about `deps` at
[Typical attributes defined by\
most build rules](common-definitions.html#typical-attributes).
 `srcs`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The list of source files that are processed to create the target.
This attribute is almost always required; see exceptions below.

Source files of type `.java` are compiled. In case of generated
`.java` files it is generally advisable to put the generating rule's name
here instead of the name of the file itself. This not only improves readability but
makes the rule more resilient to future changes: if the generating rule generates
different files in the future, you only need to fix one place: the `outs` of
the generating rule. You should not list the generating rule in `deps`
because it is a no-op.

Source files of type `.srcjar` are unpacked and compiled. (This is useful if
you need to generate a set of `.java` files with a genrule.)

Rules: if the rule (typically `genrule` or `filegroup`) generates
any of the files listed above, they will be used the same way as described for source
files.

This argument is almost always required, except if a
[`main_class`](#java-binary.main-class) attribute specifies a
class on the runtime classpath or you specify the `runtime_deps` argument.

`data`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The list of files needed by this library at runtime.
See general comments about `data`
at [Typical attributes defined by\
most build rules](/reference/be/common-definitions#typical-attributes).
 `resources`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 A list of data files to include in a Java jar.

Resources may be source files or generated files.

If resources are specified, they will be bundled in the jar along with the usual
`.class` files produced by compilation. The location of the resources inside
of the jar file is determined by the project structure. Bazel first looks for Maven's
[standard directory layout](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html),
(a "src" directory followed by a "resources" directory grandchild). If that is not
found, Bazel then looks for the topmost directory named "java" or "javatests" (so, for
example, if a resource is at `<workspace root>/x/java/y/java/z`, the
path of the resource will be `y/java/z`. This heuristic cannot be overridden,
however, the `resource_strip_prefix` attribute can be used to specify a
specific alternative directory for resource files.


`add_exports`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 Allow this library to access the given `module` or `package`.

This corresponds to the javac and JVM --add-exports= flags.


`add_opens`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 Allow this library to reflectively access the given `module` or
`package`.

This corresponds to the javac and JVM --add-opens= flags.


`bootclasspath`

[Label](/concepts/labels); default is `None`

 Restricted API, do not use!
 `classpath_resources`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 _DO NOT USE THIS OPTION UNLESS THERE IS NO OTHER WAY)_

A list of resources that must be located at the root of the java tree. This attribute's
only purpose is to support third-party libraries that require that their resources be
found on the classpath as exactly `"myconfig.xml"`. It is only allowed on
binaries and not libraries, due to the danger of namespace conflicts.

`create_executable`

Boolean; default is `True`

 Deprecated, use `java_single_jar` instead.
 `deploy_env`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 A list of other `java_binary` targets which represent the deployment
environment for this binary.
Set this attribute when building a plugin which will be loaded by another
`java_binary`.

 Setting this attribute excludes all dependencies from
the runtime classpath (and the deploy jar) of this binary that are shared between this
binary and the targets specified in `deploy_env`.
 `deploy_manifest_lines`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 A list of lines to add to the `META-INF/manifest.mf` file generated for the
`*_deploy.jar` target. The contents of this attribute are _not_ subject
to ["Make variable"](make-variables.html) substitution.
 `javacopts`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 Extra compiler options for this binary.
Subject to ["Make variable"](make-variables.html) substitution and
[Bourne shell tokenization](common-definitions.html#sh-tokenization).

These compiler options are passed to javac after the global compiler options.

`jvm_flags`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 A list of flags to embed in the wrapper script generated for running this binary.
Subject to [$(location)](/reference/be/make-variables#location) and
["Make variable"](make-variables.html) substitution, and
[Bourne shell tokenization](common-definitions.html#sh-tokenization).

The wrapper script for a Java binary includes a CLASSPATH definition
(to find all the dependent jars) and invokes the right Java interpreter.
The command line generated by the wrapper script includes the name of
the main class followed by a `"$@"` so you can pass along other
arguments after the classname. However, arguments intended for parsing
by the JVM must be specified _before_ the classname on the command
line. The contents of `jvm_flags` are added to the wrapper
script before the classname is listed.

Note that this attribute has _no effect_ on `*_deploy.jar`
outputs.

`launcher`

[Label](/concepts/labels); default is `None`

 Specify a binary that will be used to run your Java program instead of the
normal `bin/java` program included with the JDK.
The target must be a `cc_binary`. Any `cc_binary` that
implements the
[Java Invocation API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/invocation.html) can be specified as a value for this attribute.

By default, Bazel will use the normal JDK launcher (bin/java or java.exe).

The related [`\
--java_launcher`](/docs/user-manual#flag--java_launcher) Bazel flag affects only those
`java_binary` and `java_test` targets that have
_not_ specified a `launcher` attribute.

Note that your native (C++, SWIG, JNI) dependencies will be built differently
depending on whether you are using the JDK launcher or another launcher:

- If you are using the normal JDK launcher (the default), native dependencies are
  built as a shared library named `{name}_nativedeps.so`, where
  `{name}` is the `name` attribute of this java\_binary rule.
  Unused code is _not_ removed by the linker in this configuration.
- If you are using any other launcher, native (C++) dependencies are statically
  linked into a binary named `{name}_nativedeps`, where `{name}`
  is the `name` attribute of this java\_binary rule. In this case,
  the linker will remove any code it thinks is unused from the resulting binary,
  which means any C++ code accessed only via JNI may not be linked in unless
  that `cc_library` target specifies `alwayslink = True`.

When using any launcher other than the default JDK launcher, the format
of the `*_deploy.jar` output changes. See the main
[java\_binary](#java-binary) docs for details.

`main_class`

String; default is `""`

 Name of class with `main()` method to use as entry point.
If a rule uses this option, it does not need a `srcs=[...]` list.
Thus, with this attribute one can make an executable from a Java library that already
contains one or more `main()` methods.

The value of this attribute is a class name, not a source file. The class must be
available at runtime: it may be compiled by this rule (from `srcs`) or
provided by direct or transitive dependencies (through `runtime_deps` or
`deps`). If the class is unavailable, the binary will fail at runtime; there
is no build-time check.

`neverlink`

Boolean; default is `False`

`plugins`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 Java compiler plugins to run at compile-time.
Every `java_plugin` specified in this attribute will be run whenever this rule
is built. A library may also inherit plugins from dependencies that use
`exported_plugins`. Resources
generated by the plugin will be included in the resulting jar of this rule.
 `resource_strip_prefix`

String; default is `""`

 The path prefix to strip from Java resources.

If specified, this path prefix is stripped from every file in the `resources`
attribute. It is an error for a resource file not to be under this directory. If not
specified (the default), the path of resource file is determined according to the same
logic as the Java package of source files. For example, a source file at
`stuff/java/foo/bar/a.txt` will be located at `foo/bar/a.txt`.

`runtime_deps`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 Libraries to make available to the final binary or test at runtime only.
Like ordinary `deps`, these will appear on the runtime classpath, but unlike
them, not on the compile-time classpath. Dependencies needed only at runtime should be
listed here. Dependency-analysis tools should ignore targets that appear in both
`runtime_deps` and `deps`.
 `stamp`

Integer; default is `-1`

 Whether to encode build information into the binary. Possible values:

- `stamp = 1`: Always stamp the build information into the binary, even in
   [`--nostamp`](/docs/user-manual#flag--stamp) builds. **This**
  **setting should be avoided**, since it potentially kills remote caching for the
   binary and any downstream actions that depend on it.

- `stamp = 0`: Always replace build information by constant values. This
   gives good build result caching.

- `stamp = -1`: Embedding of build information is controlled by the
   [`--[no]stamp`](/docs/user-manual#flag--stamp) flag.


Stamped binaries are _not_ rebuilt unless their dependencies change.

`use_launcher`

Boolean; default is `True`

 Whether the binary should use a custom launcher.

If this attribute is set to false, the
[launcher](/reference/be/java.html#java_binary.launcher) attribute and the related
[`--java_launcher`](/docs/user-manual#flag--java_launcher) flag
will be ignored for this target.


`use_testrunner`

Boolean; default is `False`

 Use the test runner (by default
`com.google.testing.junit.runner.BazelTestRunner`) class as the
main entry point for a Java program, and provide the test class
to the test runner as a value of `bazel.test_suite`
system property.

You can use this to override the default
behavior, which is to use test runner for
`java_test` rules,
and not use it for `java_binary` rules. It is unlikely
you will want to do this. One use is for `AllTest`
rules that are invoked by another rule (to set up a database
before running the tests, for example). The `AllTest`
rule must be declared as a `java_binary`, but should
still use the test runner as its main entry point.

The name of a test runner class can be overridden with `main_class` attribute.


## java\_import

[View rule sourceopen\_in\_new](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_java/blob/master/java/bazel/rules/bazel_java_import.bzl)

```
java_import(name, deps, data, add_exports, add_opens, aspect_hints, compatible_with, constraints, deprecation, exec_compatible_with, exec_group_compatible_with, exec_properties, exports, features, jars, licenses, neverlink, package_metadata, proguard_specs, restricted_to, runtime_deps, srcjar, tags, target_compatible_with, testonly, toolchains, visibility)
```

This rule allows the use of precompiled `.jar` files as
libraries for `java_library` and
`java_binary` rules.

#### Examples

```lang-starlark

    java_import(
        name = "maven_model",
        jars = [
            "maven_model/maven-aether-provider-3.2.3.jar",
            "maven_model/maven-model-3.2.3.jar",
            "maven_model/maven-model-builder-3.2.3.jar",
        ],
    )

```

### Arguments

Attributes`name`

[Name](/concepts/labels#target-names); required

A unique name for this target.

`deps`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The list of other libraries to be linked in to the target.
See [java\_library.deps](/reference/be/java.html#java_library.deps).
 `data`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The list of files needed by this rule at runtime.
 `add_exports`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 Allow this library to access the given `module` or `package`.

This corresponds to the javac and JVM --add-exports= flags.


`add_opens`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 Allow this library to reflectively access the given `module` or
`package`.

This corresponds to the javac and JVM --add-opens= flags.


`constraints`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 Extra constraints imposed on this rule as a Java library.
 `exports`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 Targets to make available to users of this rule.
See [java\_library.exports](/reference/be/java.html#java_library.exports).
 `jars`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); required

 The list of JAR files provided to Java targets that depend on this target.
 `neverlink`

Boolean; default is `False`

 Only use this library for compilation and not at runtime.
Useful if the library will be provided by the runtime environment
during execution. Examples of libraries like this are IDE APIs
for IDE plug-ins or `tools.jar` for anything running on
a standard JDK.
 `proguard_specs`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 Files to be used as Proguard specification.
These will describe the set of specifications to be used by Proguard. If specified,
they will be added to any `android_binary` target depending on this library.

The files included here must only have idempotent rules, namely -dontnote, -dontwarn,
assumenosideeffects, and rules that start with -keep. Other options can only appear in
`android_binary`'s proguard\_specs, to ensure non-tautological merges.
 `runtime_deps`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 Libraries to make available to the final binary or test at runtime only.
See [java\_library.runtime\_deps](/reference/be/java.html#java_library.runtime_deps).
 `srcjar`

[Label](/concepts/labels); default is `None`

 A JAR file that contains source code for the compiled JAR files.


## java\_library

[View rule sourceopen\_in\_new](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_java/blob/master/java/bazel/rules/bazel_java_library.bzl)

```
java_library(name, deps, srcs, data, resources, add_exports, add_opens, aspect_hints, bootclasspath, compatible_with, deprecation, exec_compatible_with, exec_group_compatible_with, exec_properties, exported_plugins, exports, features, javabuilder_jvm_flags, javacopts, licenses, neverlink, package_metadata, plugins, proguard_specs, resource_strip_prefix, restricted_to, runtime_deps, tags, target_compatible_with, testonly, toolchains, visibility)
```

This rule compiles and links sources into a `.jar` file.

#### Implicit outputs

- `libname.jar`: A Java archive containing the class files.
- `libname-src.jar`: An archive containing the sources ("source
   jar").

### Arguments

Attributes`name`

[Name](/concepts/labels#target-names); required

A unique name for this target.

`deps`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The list of libraries to link into this library.
See general comments about `deps` at
[Typical attributes defined by\
most build rules](/reference/be/common-definitions#typical-attributes).

The jars built by `java_library` rules listed in `deps` will be on
the compile-time classpath of this rule. Furthermore the transitive closure of their
`deps`, `runtime_deps` and `exports` will be on the
runtime classpath.

By contrast, targets in the `data` attribute are included in the runfiles but
on neither the compile-time nor runtime classpath.

`srcs`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The list of source files that are processed to create the target.
This attribute is almost always required; see exceptions below.

Source files of type `.java` are compiled. In case of generated
`.java` files it is generally advisable to put the generating rule's name
here instead of the name of the file itself. This not only improves readability but
makes the rule more resilient to future changes: if the generating rule generates
different files in the future, you only need to fix one place: the `outs` of
the generating rule. You should not list the generating rule in `deps`
because it is a no-op.

Source files of type `.srcjar` are unpacked and compiled. (This is useful if
you need to generate a set of `.java` files with a genrule.)

Rules: if the rule (typically `genrule` or `filegroup`) generates
any of the files listed above, they will be used the same way as described for source
files.

Source files of type `.properties` are treated as resources.

All other files are ignored, as long as there is at least one file of a
file type described above. Otherwise an error is raised.

This argument is almost always required, except if you specify the `runtime_deps` argument.

`data`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The list of files needed by this library at runtime.
See general comments about `data` at
[Typical attributes defined by\
most build rules](/reference/be/common-definitions#typical-attributes).

When building a `java_library`, Bazel doesn't put these files anywhere; if the
`data` files are generated files then Bazel generates them. When building a
test that depends on this `java_library` Bazel copies or links the
`data` files into the runfiles area.

`resources`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 A list of data files to include in a Java jar.

Resources may be source files or generated files.

If resources are specified, they will be bundled in the jar along with the usual
`.class` files produced by compilation. The location of the resources inside
of the jar file is determined by the project structure. Bazel first looks for Maven's
[standard directory layout](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html),
(a "src" directory followed by a "resources" directory grandchild). If that is not
found, Bazel then looks for the topmost directory named "java" or "javatests" (so, for
example, if a resource is at `<workspace root>/x/java/y/java/z`, the
path of the resource will be `y/java/z`. This heuristic cannot be overridden,
however, the `resource_strip_prefix` attribute can be used to specify a
specific alternative directory for resource files.


`add_exports`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 Allow this library to access the given `module` or `package`.

This corresponds to the javac and JVM --add-exports= flags.


`add_opens`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 Allow this library to reflectively access the given `module` or
`package`.

This corresponds to the javac and JVM --add-opens= flags.


`bootclasspath`

[Label](/concepts/labels); default is `None`

 Restricted API, do not use!
 `exported_plugins`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The list of `java_plugin` s (e.g. annotation
processors) to export to libraries that directly depend on this library.

The specified list of `java_plugin` s will be applied to any library which
directly depends on this library, just as if that library had explicitly declared these
labels in `plugins`.

`exports`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 Exported libraries.

Listing rules here will make them available to parent rules, as if the parents explicitly
depended on these rules. This is not true for regular (non-exported) `deps`.

Summary: a rule _X_ can access the code in _Y_ if there exists a dependency
path between them that begins with a `deps` edge followed by zero or more
`exports` edges. Let's see some examples to illustrate this.

Assume _A_ depends on _B_ and _B_ depends on _C_. In this case
C is a _transitive_ dependency of A, so changing C's sources and rebuilding A will
correctly rebuild everything. However A will not be able to use classes in C. To allow
that, either A has to declare C in its `deps`, or B can make it easier for A
(and anything that may depend on A) by declaring C in its (B's) `exports`
attribute.

The closure of exported libraries is available to all direct parent rules. Take a slightly
different example: A depends on B, B depends on C and D, and also exports C but not D.
Now A has access to C but not to D. Now, if C and D exported some libraries, C' and D'
respectively, A could only access C' but not D'.

Important: an exported rule is not a regular dependency. Sticking to the previous example,
if B exports C and wants to also use C, it has to also list it in its own
`deps`.

`javabuilder_jvm_flags`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 Restricted API, do not use!
 `javacopts`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 Extra compiler options for this library.
Subject to ["Make variable"](make-variables.html) substitution and
[Bourne shell tokenization](common-definitions.html#sh-tokenization).

These compiler options are passed to javac after the global compiler options.

`neverlink`

Boolean; default is `False`

 Whether this library should only be used for compilation and not at runtime.
Useful if the library will be provided by the runtime environment during execution. Examples
of such libraries are the IDE APIs for IDE plug-ins or `tools.jar` for anything
running on a standard JDK.

Note that `neverlink = True` does not prevent the compiler from inlining material
from this library into compilation targets that depend on it, as permitted by the Java
Language Specification (e.g., `static final` constants of `String`
or of primitive types). The preferred use case is therefore when the runtime library is
identical to the compilation library.

If the runtime library differs from the compilation library then you must ensure that it
differs only in places that the JLS forbids compilers to inline (and that must hold for
all future versions of the JLS).

`plugins`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 Java compiler plugins to run at compile-time.
Every `java_plugin` specified in this attribute will be run whenever this rule
is built. A library may also inherit plugins from dependencies that use
`exported_plugins`. Resources
generated by the plugin will be included in the resulting jar of this rule.
 `proguard_specs`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 Files to be used as Proguard specification.
These will describe the set of specifications to be used by Proguard. If specified,
they will be added to any `android_binary` target depending on this library.

The files included here must only have idempotent rules, namely -dontnote, -dontwarn,
assumenosideeffects, and rules that start with -keep. Other options can only appear in
`android_binary`'s proguard\_specs, to ensure non-tautological merges.
 `resource_strip_prefix`

String; default is `""`

 The path prefix to strip from Java resources.

If specified, this path prefix is stripped from every file in the `resources`
attribute. It is an error for a resource file not to be under this directory. If not
specified (the default), the path of resource file is determined according to the same
logic as the Java package of source files. For example, a source file at
`stuff/java/foo/bar/a.txt` will be located at `foo/bar/a.txt`.

`runtime_deps`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 Libraries to make available to the final binary or test at runtime only.
Like ordinary `deps`, these will appear on the runtime classpath, but unlike
them, not on the compile-time classpath. Dependencies needed only at runtime should be
listed here. Dependency-analysis tools should ignore targets that appear in both
`runtime_deps` and `deps`.


## java\_test

[View rule sourceopen\_in\_new](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_java/blob/master/java/bazel/rules/bazel_java_test.bzl)

```
java_test(name, deps, srcs, data, resources, add_exports, add_opens, args, aspect_hints, bootclasspath, classpath_resources, compatible_with, create_executable, deploy_manifest_lines, deprecation, env, env_inherit, exec_compatible_with, exec_group_compatible_with, exec_properties, features, flaky, javacopts, jvm_flags, launcher, licenses, local, main_class, neverlink, package_metadata, plugins, resource_strip_prefix, restricted_to, runtime_deps, shard_count, size, stamp, tags, target_compatible_with, test_class, testonly, timeout, toolchains, use_launcher, use_testrunner, visibility)
```

A `java_test()` rule compiles a Java test. A test is a binary wrapper around your
test code. The test runner's main method is invoked instead of the main class being compiled.

#### Implicit output targets

- `name.jar`: A Java archive.
- `name_deploy.jar`: A Java archive suitable
   for deployment. (Only built if explicitly requested.) See the description of the
   `name_deploy.jar` output from
   [java\_binary](#java-binary) for more details.

See the section on `java_binary()` arguments. This rule also
supports all [attributes common\
to all test rules (\*\_test)](https://bazel.build/reference/be/common-definitions#common-attributes-tests).

#### Examples

```lang-starlark

java_library(
    name = "tests",
    srcs = glob(["*.java"]),
    deps = [
        "//java/com/foo/base:testResources",
        "//java/com/foo/testing/util",
    ],
)

java_test(
    name = "AllTests",
    size = "small",
    runtime_deps = [
        ":tests",
        "//util/mysql",
    ],
)

```

### Arguments

Attributes`name`

[Name](/concepts/labels#target-names); required

A unique name for this target.

`deps`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The list of other libraries to be linked in to the target.
See general comments about `deps` at
[Typical attributes defined by\
most build rules](common-definitions.html#typical-attributes).
 `srcs`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The list of source files that are processed to create the target.
This attribute is almost always required; see exceptions below.

Source files of type `.java` are compiled. In case of generated
`.java` files it is generally advisable to put the generating rule's name
here instead of the name of the file itself. This not only improves readability but
makes the rule more resilient to future changes: if the generating rule generates
different files in the future, you only need to fix one place: the `outs` of
the generating rule. You should not list the generating rule in `deps`
because it is a no-op.

Source files of type `.srcjar` are unpacked and compiled. (This is useful if
you need to generate a set of `.java` files with a genrule.)

Rules: if the rule (typically `genrule` or `filegroup`) generates
any of the files listed above, they will be used the same way as described for source
files.

This argument is almost always required, except if a
[`main_class`](#java-binary.main-class) attribute specifies a
class on the runtime classpath or you specify the `runtime_deps` argument.

`data`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The list of files needed by this library at runtime.
See general comments about `data`
at [Typical attributes defined by\
most build rules](/reference/be/common-definitions#typical-attributes).
 `resources`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 A list of data files to include in a Java jar.

Resources may be source files or generated files.

If resources are specified, they will be bundled in the jar along with the usual
`.class` files produced by compilation. The location of the resources inside
of the jar file is determined by the project structure. Bazel first looks for Maven's
[standard directory layout](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html),
(a "src" directory followed by a "resources" directory grandchild). If that is not
found, Bazel then looks for the topmost directory named "java" or "javatests" (so, for
example, if a resource is at `<workspace root>/x/java/y/java/z`, the
path of the resource will be `y/java/z`. This heuristic cannot be overridden,
however, the `resource_strip_prefix` attribute can be used to specify a
specific alternative directory for resource files.


`add_exports`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 Allow this library to access the given `module` or `package`.

This corresponds to the javac and JVM --add-exports= flags.


`add_opens`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 Allow this library to reflectively access the given `module` or
`package`.

This corresponds to the javac and JVM --add-opens= flags.


`bootclasspath`

[Label](/concepts/labels); default is `None`

 Restricted API, do not use!
 `classpath_resources`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 _DO NOT USE THIS OPTION UNLESS THERE IS NO OTHER WAY)_

A list of resources that must be located at the root of the java tree. This attribute's
only purpose is to support third-party libraries that require that their resources be
found on the classpath as exactly `"myconfig.xml"`. It is only allowed on
binaries and not libraries, due to the danger of namespace conflicts.

`create_executable`

Boolean; default is `True`

 Deprecated, use `java_single_jar` instead.
 `deploy_manifest_lines`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 A list of lines to add to the `META-INF/manifest.mf` file generated for the
`*_deploy.jar` target. The contents of this attribute are _not_ subject
to ["Make variable"](make-variables.html) substitution.
 `javacopts`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 Extra compiler options for this binary.
Subject to ["Make variable"](make-variables.html) substitution and
[Bourne shell tokenization](common-definitions.html#sh-tokenization).

These compiler options are passed to javac after the global compiler options.

`jvm_flags`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 A list of flags to embed in the wrapper script generated for running this binary.
Subject to [$(location)](/reference/be/make-variables#location) and
["Make variable"](make-variables.html) substitution, and
[Bourne shell tokenization](common-definitions.html#sh-tokenization).

The wrapper script for a Java binary includes a CLASSPATH definition
(to find all the dependent jars) and invokes the right Java interpreter.
The command line generated by the wrapper script includes the name of
the main class followed by a `"$@"` so you can pass along other
arguments after the classname. However, arguments intended for parsing
by the JVM must be specified _before_ the classname on the command
line. The contents of `jvm_flags` are added to the wrapper
script before the classname is listed.

Note that this attribute has _no effect_ on `*_deploy.jar`
outputs.

`launcher`

[Label](/concepts/labels); default is `None`

 Specify a binary that will be used to run your Java program instead of the
normal `bin/java` program included with the JDK.
The target must be a `cc_binary`. Any `cc_binary` that
implements the
[Java Invocation API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/invocation.html) can be specified as a value for this attribute.

By default, Bazel will use the normal JDK launcher (bin/java or java.exe).

The related [`\
--java_launcher`](/docs/user-manual#flag--java_launcher) Bazel flag affects only those
`java_binary` and `java_test` targets that have
_not_ specified a `launcher` attribute.

Note that your native (C++, SWIG, JNI) dependencies will be built differently
depending on whether you are using the JDK launcher or another launcher:

- If you are using the normal JDK launcher (the default), native dependencies are
  built as a shared library named `{name}_nativedeps.so`, where
  `{name}` is the `name` attribute of this java\_binary rule.
  Unused code is _not_ removed by the linker in this configuration.
- If you are using any other launcher, native (C++) dependencies are statically
  linked into a binary named `{name}_nativedeps`, where `{name}`
  is the `name` attribute of this java\_binary rule. In this case,
  the linker will remove any code it thinks is unused from the resulting binary,
  which means any C++ code accessed only via JNI may not be linked in unless
  that `cc_library` target specifies `alwayslink = True`.

When using any launcher other than the default JDK launcher, the format
of the `*_deploy.jar` output changes. See the main
[java\_binary](#java-binary) docs for details.

`main_class`

String; default is `""`

 Name of class with `main()` method to use as entry point.
If a rule uses this option, it does not need a `srcs=[...]` list.
Thus, with this attribute one can make an executable from a Java library that already
contains one or more `main()` methods.

The value of this attribute is a class name, not a source file. The class must be
available at runtime: it may be compiled by this rule (from `srcs`) or
provided by direct or transitive dependencies (through `runtime_deps` or
`deps`). If the class is unavailable, the binary will fail at runtime; there
is no build-time check.

`neverlink`

Boolean; default is `False`

`plugins`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 Java compiler plugins to run at compile-time.
Every `java_plugin` specified in this attribute will be run whenever this rule
is built. A library may also inherit plugins from dependencies that use
`exported_plugins`. Resources
generated by the plugin will be included in the resulting jar of this rule.
 `resource_strip_prefix`

String; default is `""`

 The path prefix to strip from Java resources.

If specified, this path prefix is stripped from every file in the `resources`
attribute. It is an error for a resource file not to be under this directory. If not
specified (the default), the path of resource file is determined according to the same
logic as the Java package of source files. For example, a source file at
`stuff/java/foo/bar/a.txt` will be located at `foo/bar/a.txt`.

`runtime_deps`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 Libraries to make available to the final binary or test at runtime only.
Like ordinary `deps`, these will appear on the runtime classpath, but unlike
them, not on the compile-time classpath. Dependencies needed only at runtime should be
listed here. Dependency-analysis tools should ignore targets that appear in both
`runtime_deps` and `deps`.
 `stamp`

Integer; default is `0`

 Whether to encode build information into the binary. Possible values:

- `stamp = 1`: Always stamp the build information into the binary, even in
   [`--nostamp`](https://bazel.build/docs/user-manual#stamp) builds. **This**
  **setting should be avoided**, since it potentially kills remote caching for the
   binary and any downstream actions that depend on it.

- `stamp = 0`: Always replace build information by constant values. This
   gives good build result caching.

- `stamp = -1`: Embedding of build information is controlled by the
   [`--[no]stamp`](https://bazel.build/docs/user-manual#stamp) flag.


Stamped binaries are _not_ rebuilt unless their dependencies change.

`test_class`

String; default is `""`

 The Java class to be loaded by the test runner.

By default, if this argument is not defined then the legacy mode is used and the
test arguments are used instead. Set the `--nolegacy_bazel_java_test` flag
to not fallback on the first argument.

This attribute specifies the name of a Java class to be run by
this test. It is rare to need to set this. If this argument is omitted,
it will be inferred using the target's `name` and its
source-root-relative path. If the test is located outside a known
source root, Bazel will report an error if `test_class`
is unset.

For JUnit3, the test class needs to either be a subclass of
`junit.framework.TestCase` or it needs to have a public
static `suite()` method that returns a
`junit.framework.Test` (or a subclass of `Test`).

This attribute allows several `java_test` rules to
share the same `Test`
( `TestCase`, `TestSuite`, ...). Typically
additional information is passed to it
(e.g. via `jvm_flags=['-Dkey=value']`) so that its
behavior differs in each case, such as running a different
subset of the tests. This attribute also enables the use of
Java tests outside the `javatests` tree.

`use_launcher`

Boolean; default is `True`

 Whether the binary should use a custom launcher.

If this attribute is set to false, the
[launcher](/reference/be/java.html#java_binary.launcher) attribute and the related
[`--java_launcher`](/docs/user-manual#flag--java_launcher) flag
will be ignored for this target.


`use_testrunner`

Boolean; default is `True`

 Use the test runner (by default
`com.google.testing.junit.runner.BazelTestRunner`) class as the
main entry point for a Java program, and provide the test class
to the test runner as a value of `bazel.test_suite`
system property.

You can use this to override the default
behavior, which is to use test runner for
`java_test` rules,
and not use it for `java_binary` rules. It is unlikely
you will want to do this. One use is for `AllTest`
rules that are invoked by another rule (to set up a database
before running the tests, for example). The `AllTest`
rule must be declared as a `java_binary`, but should
still use the test runner as its main entry point.

The name of a test runner class can be overridden with `main_class` attribute.


## java\_package\_configuration

[View rule sourceopen\_in\_new](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_java/blob/master/java/common/rules/java_package_configuration.bzl)

```
java_package_configuration(name, data, aspect_hints, compatible_with, deprecation, exec_compatible_with, exec_group_compatible_with, exec_properties, features, javacopts, output_licenses, package_metadata, packages, restricted_to, system, tags, target_compatible_with, testonly, toolchains, visibility)
```

Configuration to apply to a set of packages.
Configurations can be added to
`java_toolchain.javacopts` s.

#### Example:

```lang-starlark

java_package_configuration(
    name = "my_configuration",
    packages = [":my_packages"],
    javacopts = ["-Werror"],
)

package_group(
    name = "my_packages",
    packages = [
        "//com/my/project/...",
        "-//com/my/project/testing/...",
    ],
)

java_toolchain(
    ...,
    package_configuration = [
        ":my_configuration",
    ]
)

```

### Arguments

Attributes`name`

[Name](/concepts/labels#target-names); required

A unique name for this target.

`data`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The list of files needed by this configuration at runtime.
 `javacopts`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 Java compiler flags.
 `output_licenses`

List of strings; default is `[]`

`packages`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The set of `package_group` s
the configuration should be applied to.
 `system`

[Label](/concepts/labels); default is `None`

 Corresponds to javac's --system flag.


## java\_plugin

[View rule sourceopen\_in\_new](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_java/blob/master/java/bazel/rules/bazel_java_plugin.bzl)

```
java_plugin(name, deps, srcs, data, resources, add_exports, add_opens, aspect_hints, bootclasspath, compatible_with, deprecation, exec_compatible_with, exec_group_compatible_with, exec_properties, features, generates_api, javabuilder_jvm_flags, javacopts, licenses, neverlink, output_licenses, package_metadata, plugins, processor_class, proguard_specs, resource_strip_prefix, restricted_to, tags, target_compatible_with, testonly, toolchains, visibility)
```

`java_plugin` defines plugins for the Java compiler run by Bazel. The
only supported kind of plugins are annotation processors. A `java_library` or
`java_binary` rule can run plugins by depending on them via the `plugins`
attribute. A `java_library` can also automatically export plugins to libraries that
directly depend on it using
`exported_plugins`.

#### Implicit output targets

- `libname.jar`: A Java archive.

Arguments are a subset of (and with identical semantics to) those of
[java\_library()](/reference/be/java.html#java_library),
except for the addition of the `processor_class` and
`generates_api` arguments.

### Arguments

Attributes`name`

[Name](/concepts/labels#target-names); required

A unique name for this target.

`deps`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The list of libraries to link into this library.
See general comments about `deps` at
[Typical attributes defined by\
most build rules](/reference/be/common-definitions#typical-attributes).

The jars built by `java_library` rules listed in `deps` will be on
the compile-time classpath of this rule. Furthermore the transitive closure of their
`deps`, `runtime_deps` and `exports` will be on the
runtime classpath.

By contrast, targets in the `data` attribute are included in the runfiles but
on neither the compile-time nor runtime classpath.

`srcs`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The list of source files that are processed to create the target.
This attribute is almost always required; see exceptions below.

Source files of type `.java` are compiled. In case of generated
`.java` files it is generally advisable to put the generating rule's name
here instead of the name of the file itself. This not only improves readability but
makes the rule more resilient to future changes: if the generating rule generates
different files in the future, you only need to fix one place: the `outs` of
the generating rule. You should not list the generating rule in `deps`
because it is a no-op.

Source files of type `.srcjar` are unpacked and compiled. (This is useful if
you need to generate a set of `.java` files with a genrule.)

Rules: if the rule (typically `genrule` or `filegroup`) generates
any of the files listed above, they will be used the same way as described for source
files.

Source files of type `.properties` are treated as resources.

All other files are ignored, as long as there is at least one file of a
file type described above. Otherwise an error is raised.

This argument is almost always required, except if you specify the `runtime_deps` argument.

`data`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The list of files needed by this library at runtime.
See general comments about `data` at
[Typical attributes defined by\
most build rules](/reference/be/common-definitions#typical-attributes).

When building a `java_library`, Bazel doesn't put these files anywhere; if the
`data` files are generated files then Bazel generates them. When building a
test that depends on this `java_library` Bazel copies or links the
`data` files into the runfiles area.

`resources`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 A list of data files to include in a Java jar.

Resources may be source files or generated files.

If resources are specified, they will be bundled in the jar along with the usual
`.class` files produced by compilation. The location of the resources inside
of the jar file is determined by the project structure. Bazel first looks for Maven's
[standard directory layout](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html),
(a "src" directory followed by a "resources" directory grandchild). If that is not
found, Bazel then looks for the topmost directory named "java" or "javatests" (so, for
example, if a resource is at `<workspace root>/x/java/y/java/z`, the
path of the resource will be `y/java/z`. This heuristic cannot be overridden,
however, the `resource_strip_prefix` attribute can be used to specify a
specific alternative directory for resource files.


`add_exports`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 Allow this library to access the given `module` or `package`.

This corresponds to the javac and JVM --add-exports= flags.


`add_opens`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 Allow this library to reflectively access the given `module` or
`package`.

This corresponds to the javac and JVM --add-opens= flags.


`bootclasspath`

[Label](/concepts/labels); default is `None`

 Restricted API, do not use!
 `generates_api`

Boolean; default is `False`

 This attribute marks annotation processors that generate API code.

If a rule uses an API-generating annotation processor, other rules
depending on it can refer to the generated code only if their
compilation actions are scheduled after the generating rule. This
attribute instructs Bazel to introduce scheduling constraints when
--java\_header\_compilation is enabled.

_WARNING: This attribute affects build_
_performance, use it only if necessary._

`javabuilder_jvm_flags`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 Restricted API, do not use!
 `javacopts`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 Extra compiler options for this library.
Subject to ["Make variable"](make-variables.html) substitution and
[Bourne shell tokenization](common-definitions.html#sh-tokenization).

These compiler options are passed to javac after the global compiler options.

`neverlink`

Boolean; default is `False`

 Whether this library should only be used for compilation and not at runtime.
Useful if the library will be provided by the runtime environment during execution. Examples
of such libraries are the IDE APIs for IDE plug-ins or `tools.jar` for anything
running on a standard JDK.

Note that `neverlink = True` does not prevent the compiler from inlining material
from this library into compilation targets that depend on it, as permitted by the Java
Language Specification (e.g., `static final` constants of `String`
or of primitive types). The preferred use case is therefore when the runtime library is
identical to the compilation library.

If the runtime library differs from the compilation library then you must ensure that it
differs only in places that the JLS forbids compilers to inline (and that must hold for
all future versions of the JLS).

`output_licenses`

List of strings; default is `[]`

`plugins`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 Java compiler plugins to run at compile-time.
Every `java_plugin` specified in this attribute will be run whenever this rule
is built. A library may also inherit plugins from dependencies that use
`exported_plugins`. Resources
generated by the plugin will be included in the resulting jar of this rule.
 `processor_class`

String; default is `""`

 The processor class is the fully qualified type of the class that the Java compiler should
use as entry point to the annotation processor. If not specified, this rule will not
contribute an annotation processor to the Java compiler's annotation processing, but its
runtime classpath will still be included on the compiler's annotation processor path. (This
is primarily intended for use by
[Error Prone plugins](https://errorprone.info/docs/plugins), which are loaded
from the annotation processor path using
[java.util.ServiceLoader](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html).)
 `proguard_specs`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 Files to be used as Proguard specification.
These will describe the set of specifications to be used by Proguard. If specified,
they will be added to any `android_binary` target depending on this library.

The files included here must only have idempotent rules, namely -dontnote, -dontwarn,
assumenosideeffects, and rules that start with -keep. Other options can only appear in
`android_binary`'s proguard\_specs, to ensure non-tautological merges.
 `resource_strip_prefix`

String; default is `""`

 The path prefix to strip from Java resources.

If specified, this path prefix is stripped from every file in the `resources`
attribute. It is an error for a resource file not to be under this directory. If not
specified (the default), the path of resource file is determined according to the same
logic as the Java package of source files. For example, a source file at
`stuff/java/foo/bar/a.txt` will be located at `foo/bar/a.txt`.

## java\_runtime

[View rule sourceopen\_in\_new](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_java/blob/master/java/common/rules/java_runtime.bzl)

```
java_runtime(name, srcs, aspect_hints, compatible_with, default_cds, deprecation, exec_compatible_with, exec_group_compatible_with, exec_properties, features, hermetic_srcs, hermetic_static_libs, java, java_home, lib_ct_sym, lib_modules, output_licenses, package_metadata, restricted_to, tags, target_compatible_with, testonly, toolchains, version, visibility)
```

Specifies the configuration for a Java runtime.

#### Example:

```lang-starlark

java_runtime(
    name = "jdk-9-ea+153",
    srcs = glob(["jdk9-ea+153/**"]),
    java_home = "jdk9-ea+153",
)

```

### Arguments

Attributes`name`

[Name](/concepts/labels#target-names); required

A unique name for this target.

`srcs`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 All files in the runtime.
 `default_cds`

[Label](/concepts/labels); default is `None`

 Default CDS archive for hermetic `java_runtime`. When hermetic
is enabled for a `java_binary` target the `java_runtime`
default CDS is packaged in the hermetic deploy JAR.
 `hermetic_srcs`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 Files in the runtime needed for hermetic deployments.
 `hermetic_static_libs`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The libraries that are statically linked with the launcher for hermetic deployments
 `java`

[Label](/concepts/labels); default is `None`

 The path to the java executable.
 `java_home`

String; default is `""`

 The path to the root of the runtime.
Subject to ["Make" variable](/reference/be/make-variables) substitution.
If this path is absolute, the rule denotes a non-hermetic Java runtime with a well-known
path. In that case, the `srcs` and `java` attributes must be empty.
 `lib_ct_sym`

[Label](/concepts/labels); default is `None`

 The lib/ct.sym file needed for compilation with `--release`. If not specified and
there is exactly one file in `srcs` whose path ends with
`/lib/ct.sym`, that file is used.
 `lib_modules`

[Label](/concepts/labels); default is `None`

 The lib/modules file needed for hermetic deployments.
 `output_licenses`

List of strings; default is `[]`

`version`

Integer; default is `0`

 The feature version of the Java runtime. I.e., the integer returned by
`Runtime.version().feature()`.


## java\_single\_jar

[View rule sourceopen\_in\_new](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_java/blob/master/java/java_single_jar.bzl)

```
java_single_jar(name, deps, aspect_hints, compatible_with, compress, deploy_env, deploy_manifest_lines, deprecation, exclude_build_data, exec_compatible_with, exec_group_compatible_with, exec_properties, features, multi_release, package_metadata, restricted_to, tags, target_compatible_with, testonly, toolchains, visibility)
```

 Collects Java dependencies and jar files into a single jar

\`java\_single\_jar\` collects Java dependencies and jar files into a single jar.
This is similar to java\_binary with everything related to executables disabled,
and provides an alternative to the java\_binary "deploy jar hack".

\## Example

\`\`\`skylark
load("//tools/build\_defs/java\_single\_jar:java\_single\_jar.bzl", "java\_single\_jar")

java\_single\_jar(
 name = "my\_single\_jar",
 deps = \[
 "//java/com/google/foo",
 "//java/com/google/bar",
 \],
)
\`\`\`

Outputs:
 {name}.jar: A single jar containing all of the inputs.



### Arguments

Attributes`name`

[Name](/concepts/labels#target-names); required

A unique name for this target.

`deps`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 The Java targets (including java\_import and java\_library) to collect
transitive dependencies from. Runtime dependencies are collected via
deps, exports, and runtime\_deps. Resources are also collected.
Native cc\_library or java\_wrap\_cc dependencies are not.
 `compress`

String; default is `"preserve"`

 Whether to always deflate ("yes"), always store ("no"), or pass
through unmodified ("preserve"). The default is "preserve", and is the
most efficient option -- no extra work is done to inflate or deflate.
 `deploy_env`

List of [labels](/concepts/labels); default is `[]`

 A list of \`java\_binary\` or \`java\_single\_jar\` targets which represent
the deployment environment for this binary.

Set this attribute when building a plugin which will be loaded by another
\`java\_binary\`.

\`deploy\_env\` dependencies are excluded from the jar built by this rule.
 `deploy_manifest_lines`

List of strings; default is `[]`

 A list of lines to add to the `META-INF/manifest.mf` file.
 `exclude_build_data`

Boolean; default is `True`

 Whether to omit the build-data.properties file generated
by default.
 `multi_release`

Boolean; default is `True`

 Whether to enable Multi-Release output jars.


## java\_toolchain

```

Specifies the configuration for the Java compiler. Which toolchain to be used can be changed through
the --java\_toolchain argument. Normally you should not write those kind of rules unless you want to
tune your Java compiler.

#### Examples

A simple example would be:

```lang-starlark

java_toolchain(
    name = "toolchain",
    source_version = "7",
    target_version = "7",
    bootclasspath = ["//tools/jdk:bootclasspath"],
    xlint = [ "classfile", "divzero", "empty", "options", "path" ],
    javacopts = [ "-g" ],
    javabuilder = ":JavaBuilder_deploy.jar",
)

```
