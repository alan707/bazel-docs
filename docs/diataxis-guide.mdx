# Understanding the Diataxis Documentation Framework

Bazel documentation is organized using the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/), a systematic approach to technical documentation that makes it easier for you to find exactly what you need, when you need it.

## The Four Types of Documentation

Diataxis organizes documentation into four distinct categories, each serving a different purpose:

### 1. Tutorials (Learning-Oriented)

**Purpose:** Take you by the hand through practical, hands-on exercises

**Best for:** When you're learning Bazel for the first time or exploring a new feature

**Characteristics:**
- Step-by-step instructions
- Focus on successfully completing a task
- Learning through doing
- Safety and confidence building

**Examples in Bazel docs:**
- Your first C++ build
- Your first Java build  
- Writing your first rule
- Building an Android app

<Tip>
If you're new to Bazel, start with the **Tutorials** tab. These guides will walk you through your first builds step-by-step.
</Tip>

### 2. How-to Guides (Task-Oriented)

**Purpose:** Help you solve a specific real-world problem or achieve a particular goal

**Best for:** When you already understand Bazel basics and need to accomplish something specific

**Characteristics:**
- Focused on a single task or problem
- Assumes you're already competent with Bazel
- Practical directions to get work done
- No unnecessary explanation

**Examples in Bazel docs:**
- How to set up remote caching
- How to optimize build performance
- How to migrate from Maven
- How to configure code coverage

<Note>
How-to guides assume you understand Bazel fundamentals. If something is unfamiliar, check the **Explanation** tab for background context.
</Note>

### 3. Reference (Information-Oriented)

**Purpose:** Provide technical specifications, facts, and precise information

**Best for:** When you need to look up exact syntax, API details, or technical specifications

**Characteristics:**
- Dry, factual information
- Comprehensive and accurate
- Neutral tone (just the facts)
- Organized to mirror Bazel's structure

**Examples in Bazel docs:**
- Build encyclopedia (all rule definitions)
- Starlark language specification
- Command-line reference
- Glossary of terms

<Tip>
Think of reference documentation like a dictionary or encyclopedia—use it when you need to look something up, not to learn from scratch.
</Tip>

### 4. Explanation (Understanding-Oriented)

**Purpose:** Provide context, background, and help you understand the "why" behind Bazel

**Best for:** When you want to deepen your understanding or learn about concepts and design decisions

**Characteristics:**
- Discusses topics from different angles
- Provides context and background
- Explains "why" things work the way they do
- Can include opinions and perspectives

**Examples in Bazel docs:**
- Why use Bazel?
- Understanding artifact-based builds
- Build system fundamentals
- Hermeticity concepts

<Note>
Explanation docs help you build a mental model of how Bazel works. They're great for after you've completed some tutorials and want to understand concepts more deeply.
</Note>

## How to Use This Framework

### Starting Your Bazel Journey

1. **Complete a tutorial** from the Tutorials tab (e.g., "Your first C++ build")
2. **Read explanations** about concepts you encountered (e.g., "Understanding BUILD files")
3. **Try a how-to guide** for your specific use case (e.g., "Setting up remote caching")
4. **Reference documentation** as needed when writing BUILD files or rules

### When You're Stuck

| Your Situation | Where to Look |
|----------------|---------------|
| "I want to learn Bazel from scratch" | **Tutorials** tab |
| "I need to accomplish X" | **How-to Guides** tab |
| "What's the exact syntax for Y?" | **Reference** tab |
| "Why does Bazel work this way?" | **Explanation** tab |

### Common Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I'm a complete beginner">
    1. Start with **Tutorials → First Steps with Bazel**
    2. Read **Explanation → Why Bazel?** for context
    3. Complete more **Tutorials** for your language (C++, Java, etc.)
    4. Reference **How-to Guides** as you build real projects
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm migrating from another build system">
    1. Read **Explanation → Build System Fundamentals** to understand differences
    2. Follow **How-to Guides → Migration** for your specific system (Maven, Make, etc.)
    3. Use **Reference** documentation for syntax lookups
    4. Try **Tutorials** to learn Bazel patterns hands-on
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I need to optimize performance">
    1. Check **How-to Guides → Performance Optimization** for practical steps
    2. Read **Explanation → Distributed Builds** for background on caching
    3. Reference **Reference → Build Event Protocol** for detailed specs
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm writing custom rules">
    1. Complete **Tutorials → Writing Your First Rule**
    2. Read **Explanation → Extending Bazel Concepts**
    3. Use **How-to Guides → Distributing Rules** for packaging
    4. Reference **Reference → Language Reference** for Starlark syntax
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Why Diataxis?

The Diataxis framework solves a common documentation problem: different readers need different things at different times. By clearly separating these four types of documentation, you can:

- **Find information faster** - No more hunting through mixed content
- **Learn more effectively** - Tutorials teach, explanations clarify, without confusion
- **Work more efficiently** - How-to guides get straight to solving your problem
- **Look up details easily** - Reference material stays focused on facts

## The Diataxis Compass

When creating or updating documentation, we use this compass to ensure content stays focused:

| If the content... | ...and serves the user's... | ...then it belongs to... |
|-------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Informs action | Acquisition of skill | **Tutorials** |
| Informs action | Application of skill | **How-to Guides** |
| Informs cognition | Application of skill | **Reference** |
| Informs cognition | Acquisition of skill | **Explanation** |
