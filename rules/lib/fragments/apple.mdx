A configuration fragment for Apple platforms.

## multi_arch_platform

``` rule-signature
apple_platform apple.multi_arch_platform(platform_type)
```

The platform of the current configuration for the given platform type. This should only be invoked in a context where multiple architectures may be supported; consider [single_arch_platform](#single_arch_platform) for other cases.

## single_arch_cpu

``` rule-signature
string apple.single_arch_cpu
```

The single "effective" architecture for this configuration (e.g., `i386` or `arm64`) in the context of rule logic that is only concerned with a single architecture (such as `objc_library`, which registers single-architecture compile actions).

## single_arch_platform

``` rule-signature
apple_platform apple.single_arch_platform
```

The platform of the current configuration. This should only be invoked in a context where only a single architecture may be supported; consider [multi_arch_platform](#multi_arch_platform) for other cases.
