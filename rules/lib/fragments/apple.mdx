## multi\_arch\_platform

```
apple_platform apple.multi_arch_platform(platform_type)
```

The platform of the current configuration for the given platform type. This should only be invoked in a context where multiple architectures may be supported; consider [single\_arch\_platform](#single_arch_platform) for other cases.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `platform_type` | [string](../core/string.mdx); required  The apple platform type. |

## single\_arch\_cpu

```
string apple.single_arch_cpu
```

The single "effective" architecture for this configuration (e.g., `i386` or `arm64`) in the context of rule logic that is only concerned with a single architecture (such as `objc_library`, which registers single-architecture compile actions).

## single\_arch\_platform

```
apple_platform apple.single_arch_platform
```

The platform of the current configuration. This should only be invoked in a context where only a single architecture may be supported; consider [multi\_arch\_platform](#multi_arch_platform) for other cases.
