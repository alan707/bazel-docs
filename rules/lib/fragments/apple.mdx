## multi\_arch\_platform

```
apple_platform apple.multi_arch_platform(platform_type)
```

 The platform of the current configuration for the given platform type. This should only be invoked in a context where multiple architectures may be supported; consider [single\_arch\_platform](#single-arch-platform) for other cases.


### Parameters

ParameterDescription`platform_type`[string](../core/string.html);
 required

 The apple platform type.


## single\_arch\_cpu

```
string apple.single_arch_cpu
```

 The single "effective" architecture for this configuration (e.g., `i386` or `arm64`) in the context of rule logic that is only concerned with a single architecture (such as `objc_library`, which registers single-architecture compile actions).



## single\_arch\_platform

```
apple_platform apple.single_arch_platform
```

 The platform of the current configuration. This should only be invoked in a context where only a single architecture may be supported; consider [multi\_arch\_platform](#multi-arch-platform) for other cases.
