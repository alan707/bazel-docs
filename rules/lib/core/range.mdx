title: 'range'
---



A language built-in type to support ranges. Example of range literal:

```
x = range(1, 10, 3)
```

Accessing elements is possible using indexing (starts from `0`):

```
e = x[1]   # e == 2
```

Ranges do not support the `+` operator for concatenation.Similar to strings, ranges support slice operations:

```
range(10)[1:3]   # range(1, 3)
range(10)[::2]  # range(0, 10, 2)
range(10)[3:0:-1]  # range(3, 0, -1)
```

Ranges are immutable, as in Python 3.
