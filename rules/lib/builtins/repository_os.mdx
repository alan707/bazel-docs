Various data about the current platform Bazel is running on.

## Members

- [arch](#arch)
- [environ](#environ)
- [name](#name)

## arch

``` rule-signature
string repository_os.arch
```

A string identifying the architecture Bazel is running on (the value of the `"os.arch"` Java property converted to lower case).

## environ

``` rule-signature
dict repository_os.environ
```

The dictionary of environment variables.

**NOTE**: Retrieving an environment variable from this dictionary does not establish a dependency from a repository rule or module extension to the environment variable. To establish a dependency when looking up an environment variable, use either `repository_ctx.getenv` or `module_ctx.getenv` instead.

## name

``` rule-signature
string repository_os.name
```

A string identifying the operating system Bazel is running on (the value of the `"os.name"` Java property converted to lower case).
