title: 'macro'
---



A callable Starlark value representing a symbolic macro; in other words, the return value of
[`macro()`](../globals/bzl.html#macro). Invoking this value during package
construction time will instantiate the macro, and cause the macro's implementation function to be
evaluated (in a separate context, different from the context in which the macro value was invoked),
in most cases causing targets to be added to the package's target set. For more information, see
[Macros](https://bazel.build/extending/macros).
