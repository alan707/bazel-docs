title: 'rule'
---



A callable value representing the type of a native or Starlark rule (created by
[`rule()`](../globals/bzl.html#rule)). Calling the value during
evaluation of a package's BUILD file creates an instance of the rule and adds it to the
package's target set. For more information, visit this page about
[Rules](https://bazel.build/extending/rules).
