title: 'template_ctx'
---


A context object that is passed to the action template expansion function.

## Members

* [args](#args)
* [declare\_file](#declare_file)
* [run](#run)

## args

```
Args template_ctx.args()
```

Returns an Args object that can be used to build memory-efficient command lines.

## declare\_file

```
File template_ctx.declare_file(filename, *, directory)
```

Declares that implementation creates a file with the given filename within the specified directory.

Remember that in addition to declaring a file, you must separately create an action that emits the file. Creating that action will require passing the returned `File` object to the action's construction function.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `filename` | [string](../core/string.mdx); required  The relative path of the file within the directory. |
| `directory` | [File](../builtins/File.mdx); required  The directory in which the file should be created. |

## run

```
None template_ctx.run(*, outputs, inputs=[], executable, tools=None, arguments=[], progress_message=None)
```

Creates an action that runs an executable.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `outputs` | [sequence](../core/list.mdx) of [File](../builtins/File.mdx)s; required  List of the output files of the action. |
| `inputs` | [sequence](../core/list.mdx) of [File](../builtins/File.mdx)s; or [depset](../builtins/depset.mdx); default is `[]`  List or depset of the input files of the action. |
| `executable` | [File](../builtins/File.mdx); or [string](../core/string.mdx); or [FilesToRunProvider](../providers/FilesToRunProvider.mdx); required  The executable file to be called by the action. |
| `tools` | [sequence](../core/list.mdx); or [depset](../builtins/depset.mdx); or `None`; default is `None`  List or [`depset`](../builtins/depset.mdx) of any tools needed by the action. Tools are executable inputs that may have their own runfiles which are automatically made available to the action. When a list is provided, it can be a heterogenous collection of:  * `File`s * `FilesToRunProvider` instances * `depset`s of `File`s  `File`s from [`ctx.executable`](../builtins/ctx#executable) and `FilesToRunProvider`s which are directly in the list will have their runfiles automatically added. All tools are implicitly added as inputs. |
| `arguments` | [sequence](../core/list.mdx); default is `[]`  Command line arguments of the action. Must be a list of strings or [`actions.args()`](#args) objects. |
| `progress_message` | [string](../core/string.mdx); or `None`; default is `None`  Progress message to show to the user during the build. |
