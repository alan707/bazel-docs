title: 'apple\_platform'
---



Corresponds to Xcode's notion of a platform as would be found in `Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms`. Each platform represents an Apple platform type (such as iOS or tvOS) combined with one or more related CPU architectures. For example, the iOS simulator platform supports `x86_64` and `i386` architectures.

Specific instances of this type can be retrieved from the fields of the [apple\_common.platform](../toplevel/apple_common.html#platform) struct:

- `apple_common.platform.ios_device`
- `apple_common.platform.ios_simulator`
- `apple_common.platform.macos`
- `apple_common.platform.tvos_device`
- `apple_common.platform.tvos_simulator`
- `apple_common.platform.watchos_device`
- `apple_common.platform.watchos_simulator`

More commonly, however, the [apple](../fragments/apple.html) configuration fragment has fields/methods that allow rules to determine the platform for which a target is being built.

Example:

```
p = apple_common.platform.ios_device
print(p.name_in_plist)  # 'iPhoneOS'

```

- [platform\_type](#platform_type)

## is\_device

```
bool apple_platform.is_device
```

 Returns `True` if this platform is a device platform or `False` if it is a simulator platform.



## name

```
string apple_platform.name
```

 Returns the name aka starlarkKey of this platform.



## name\_in\_plist

```
string apple_platform.name_in_plist
```

 The name of the platform as it appears in the `CFBundleSupportedPlatforms` entry of an Info.plist file and in Xcode's platforms directory, without the extension (for example, `iPhoneOS` or `iPhoneSimulator`).

This name, when converted to lowercase (e.g., `iphoneos`, `iphonesimulator`), can be passed to Xcode's command-line tools like `ibtool` and `actool` when they expect a platform name.



## platform\_type

```
string apple_platform.platform_type
```

 Returns the platform type of this platform.
