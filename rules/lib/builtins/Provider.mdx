# Provider

{% dynamic setvar source_file "src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/starlarkbuildapi/core/ProviderApi.java" %}
{% include "\_buttons.html" %}
A constructor for simple value objects, known as provider instances.  
This value has a dual purpose:

- It is a function that can be called to construct 'struct'-like values:

  ``` python
  DataInfo = provider()
  d = DataInfo(x = 2, y = 3)
  print(d.x + d.y) # prints 5
  ```

  Note: Some providers, defined internally, do not allow instance creation

- It is a *key* to access a provider instance on a [Target](../builtins/Target.html)

  ``` python
  DataInfo = provider()
  def _rule_impl(ctx)
    ... ctx.attr.dep[DataInfo]
  ```

Create a new `Provider` using the [provider](../globals/bzl.html#provider) function.
