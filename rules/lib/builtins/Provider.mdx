title: 'Provider'
---



A constructor for simple value objects, known as provider instances.

This value has a dual purpose:

- It is a function that can be called to construct 'struct'-like values:

  ```
  DataInfo = provider()
  d = DataInfo(x = 2, y = 3)
  print(d.x + d.y) # prints 5
  ```

   Note: Some providers, defined internally, do not allow instance creation
- It is a _key_ to access a provider instance on a [Target](../builtins/Target.html)

  ```
  DataInfo = provider()
  def _rule_impl(ctx)
    ... ctx.attr.dep[DataInfo]
  ```


Create a new `Provider` using the [provider](../globals/bzl.html#provider) function.
