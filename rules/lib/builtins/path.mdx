# path

{% dynamic setvar source_file "src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/bazel/repository/starlark/StarlarkPath.java" %}
{% include "\_buttons.html" %}
A structure representing a file to be used inside a repository.

## Members

- [basename](#basename)
- [dirname](#dirname)
- [exists](#exists)
- [get_child](#get_child)
- [is_dir](#is_dir)
- [readdir](#readdir)
- [realpath](#realpath)

## basename

``` rule-signature
string path.basename
```

A string giving the basename of the file.

## dirname

``` rule-signature
path path.dirname
```

The parent directory of this file, or None if this file does not have a parent.
May return `None`.

## exists

``` rule-signature
bool path.exists
```

Returns true if the file or directory denoted by this path exists.

Note that accessing this field does *not* cause the path to be watched. If you'd like the repo rule or module extension to be sensitive to the path's existence, use the `watch()` method on the context object.

## get_child

``` rule-signature
path path.get_child(*relative_paths)
```

Returns the path obtained by joining this path with the given relative paths.

### Parameters

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed table-params">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td id="get_child.relative_paths"><code>relative_paths</code></td>
<td>required<br />
Zero or more relative path strings to append to this path with path separators added as needed.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## is_dir

``` rule-signature
bool path.is_dir
```

Returns true if this path points to a directory.

Note that accessing this field does *not* cause the path to be watched. If you'd like the repo rule or module extension to be sensitive to whether the path is a directory or a file, use the `watch()` method on the context object.

## readdir

``` rule-signature
list path.readdir(*, watch='auto')
```

Returns the list of entries in the directory denoted by this path. Each entry is a `path` object itself.

### Parameters

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed table-params">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td id="readdir.watch"><code>watch</code></td>
<td><a href="../core/string.html" class="anchor">string</a>;
default is <code>'auto'</code><br />
whether Bazel should watch the list of entries in this directory and refetch the repository or re-evaluate the module extension next time when any changes are detected. Changes to detect include entry creation, deletion, and renaming. Note that this doesn't watch the <em>contents</em> of any entries in the directory.
<p>Can be the string 'yes', 'no', or 'auto'. If set to 'auto', Bazel will only watch this directory when it is legal to do so (see <a href="repository_ctx.html#watch"><code>repository_ctx.watch()</code></a> docs for more information).</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## realpath

``` rule-signature
path path.realpath
```

Returns the canonical path for this path by repeatedly replacing all symbolic links with their referents.
