title: 'runfiles'
---



A container of information regarding a set of files required at runtime by an executable. This object should be passed via [`DefaultInfo`](../providers/DefaultInfo.html) in order to tell the build system about the runfiles needed by the outputs produced by the rule.

See [runfiles guide](https://bazel.build/extending/rules#runfiles) for details.

## empty\_filenames

```
depset runfiles.empty_filenames
```

 Returns names of empty files to create.



## files

```
depset runfiles.files
```

 Returns the set of runfiles as files.



## merge

```
runfiles runfiles.merge(other)
```

 Returns a new runfiles object that includes all the contents of this one and the argument.

_Note:_ When you have many runfiles objects to merge, use [`merge_all()`](#merge_all) rather than calling `merge` in a loop. This avoids constructing deep depset structures which can cause build failures.

### Parameters

ParameterDescription`other`[runfiles](../builtins/runfiles.html);
 required

 The runfiles object to merge into this.


## merge\_all

```
runfiles runfiles.merge_all(other)
```

 Returns a new runfiles object that includes all the contents of this one and of the runfiles objects in the argument.



### Parameters

ParameterDescription`other`[sequence](../core/list.html) of [runfiles](../builtins/runfiles.html) s;
 required

 The sequence of runfiles objects to merge into this.


## root\_symlinks

```
depset runfiles.root_symlinks
```

 Returns the set of root symlinks.



## symlinks

```
depset runfiles.symlinks
```

 Returns the set of symlinks.
