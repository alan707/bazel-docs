title: 'http repository rules'
---



The following functions can be loaded from
`@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl`.
// Generated with Stardoc: http://skydoc.bazel.build

Rules for downloading files and archives over HTTP.

### Setup

To use these rules in a module extension, load them in your .bzl file and then call them from your
extension's implementation function. For example, to use `http_archive`:

```python
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

def _my_extension_impl(mctx):
  http_archive(name = "foo", urls = [...])

my_extension = module_extension(implementation = _my_extension_impl)
```

Alternatively, you can directly call these repo rules in your MODULE.bazel file with
`use_repo_rule`:

```python
http_archive = use_repo_rule("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")
http_archive(name = "foo", urls = [...])
```

<a id="http_archive"></a>

```

Downloads a Bazel repository as a compressed archive file, decompresses it,
and makes its targets available for binding.

It supports the following file extensions: `"zip"`, `"jar"`, `"war"`, `"aar"`, `"tar"`,
`"tar.gz"`, `"tgz"`, `"tar.xz"`, `"txz"`, `"tar.zst"`, `"tzst"`, `tar.bz2`, `"ar"`,
or `"deb"`.

Examples:
  Suppose the current repository contains the source code for a chat program,
  rooted at the directory `~/chat-app`. It needs to depend on an SSL library
  which is available from http://example.com/openssl.zip. This `.zip` file
  contains the following directory structure:

  ```
  WORKSPACE
  src/
    openssl.cc
    openssl.h
  ```

  In the local repository, the user creates a `openssl.BUILD` file which
  contains the following target definition:

  ```python
  cc_library(
      name = "openssl-lib",
      srcs = ["src/openssl.cc"],
      hdrs = ["src/openssl.h"],
  )
  ```

  Targets in the `~/chat-app` repository can depend on this target if the
  following lines are added to `~/chat-app/WORKSPACE`:

  ```python
  load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

  http_archive(
      name = "my_ssl",
      url = "http://example.com/openssl.zip",
      sha256 = "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855",
      build_file = "@//:openssl.BUILD",
  )
  ```

  Then targets would specify `@my_ssl//:openssl-lib` as a dependency.

Destination directory relative to the repository directory.

The archive will be unpacked into this directory, after applying `strip_prefix`
(if any) to the file paths within the archive. For example, file
`foo-1.2.3/src/foo.h` will be unpacked to `bar/src/foo.h` if `add_prefix = "bar"`
and `strip_prefix = "foo-1.2.3"`.

<tr id="http_archive-auth_patterns">
<td><code>auth_patterns</code></td>
<td>

<a href="https://bazel.build/rules/lib/dict">Dictionary: String -> String</a>; optional

<p>

An optional dict mapping host names to custom authorization patterns.

If a URL's host name is present in this dict the value will be used as a pattern when
generating the authorization header for the http request. This enables the use of custom
authorization schemes used in a lot of common cloud storage providers.

The pattern currently supports 2 tokens: <code>&lt;login&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;password&gt;</code>, which are replaced with their equivalent value
in the netrc file for the same host name. After formatting, the result is set
as the value for the <code>Authorization</code> field of the HTTP request.

Example attribute and netrc for a http download to an oauth2 enabled API using a bearer token:

```
auth_patterns = {
    "storage.cloudprovider.com": "Bearer &lt;password&gt;"
}
```

netrc:

```
machine storage.cloudprovider.com
        password RANDOM-TOKEN
```

The final HTTP request would have the following header:

```
Authorization: Bearer RANDOM-TOKEN
```

was added to the cache by a request with the same canonical ID.

If unspecified or empty, Bazel by default uses the URLs of the file as the
canonical ID. This helps catch the common mistake of updating the URLs without
also updating the hash, resulting in builds that succeed locally but fail on
machines without the file in the cache. This behavior can be disabled with

</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr id="http_archive-strip_prefix">
<td><code>strip_prefix</code></td>
<td>

String; optional

<p>

A directory prefix to strip from the extracted files.

Many archives contain a top-level directory that contains all of the useful
files in archive. Instead of needing to specify this prefix over and over
in the `build_file`, this field can be used to strip it from all of the
extracted files.

For example, suppose you are using `foo-lib-latest.zip`, which contains the
directory `foo-lib-1.2.3/` under which there is a `WORKSPACE` file and are
`src/`, `lib/`, and `test/` directories that contain the actual code you
wish to build. Specify `strip_prefix = "foo-lib-1.2.3"` to use the
`foo-lib-1.2.3` directory as your top-level directory.

Note that if there are files outside of this directory, they will be
discarded and inaccessible (e.g., a top-level license file). This includes
files/directories that start with the prefix but are not in the directory
(e.g., `foo-lib-1.2.3.release-notes`). If the specified prefix does not
match a directory in the archive, Bazel will return an error.

Downloads a file from a URL and makes it available to be used as a file
group.

Examples:
  Suppose you need to have a debian package for your custom rules. This package
  is available from http://example.com/package.deb. Then you can add to your
  WORKSPACE file:

  ```python
  load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_file")

**ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES**

This repository rule depends on the following environment variables:

* `BAZEL_HTTP_RULES_URLS_AS_DEFAULT_CANONICAL_ID`


<a id="http_jar"></a>

## http_jar

load("@bazel//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_jar")

```

Downloads a jar from a URL and makes it available as java_import

Downloaded files must have a .jar extension.

Examples:
  Suppose the current repository contains the source code for a chat program, rooted at the
  directory `~/chat-app`. It needs to depend on an SSL library which is available from
  `http://example.com/openssl-0.2.jar`.

  Targets in the `~/chat-app` repository can depend on this target if the following lines are
  added to `~/chat-app/WORKSPACE`:

  ```python
  load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_jar")

  http_jar(
      name = "my_ssl",
      url = "http://example.com/openssl-0.2.jar",
      sha256 = "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855",
  )
  ```

  Targets would specify `@my_ssl//jar` as a dependency to depend on this jar.

  You may also reference files on the current system (localhost) by using "file:///path/to/file"
  if you are on Unix-based systems. If you're on Windows, use "file:///c:/path/to/file". In both
  examples, note the three slashes (`/`) -- the first two slashes belong to `file://` and the third
  one belongs to the absolute path to the file.

An optional dict mapping host names to custom authorization patterns.

If a URL's host name is present in this dict the value will be used as a pattern when
generating the authorization header for the http request. This enables the use of custom
authorization schemes used in a lot of common cloud storage providers.

The pattern currently supports 2 tokens: <code>&lt;login&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;password&gt;</code>, which are replaced with their equivalent value
in the netrc file for the same host name. After formatting, the result is set
as the value for the <code>Authorization</code> field of the HTTP request.

Example attribute and netrc for a http download to an oauth2 enabled API using a bearer token:

```
auth_patterns = {
    "storage.cloudprovider.com": "Bearer &lt;password&gt;"
}
```

netrc:

```
machine storage.cloudprovider.com
        password RANDOM-TOKEN
```

The final HTTP request would have the following header:

```
Authorization: Bearer RANDOM-TOKEN
```

<tr id="http_jar-canonical_id">
<td><code>canonical_id</code></td>
<td>

String; optional

<p>

A canonical ID of the file downloaded.

If specified and non-empty, Bazel will not take the file from cache, unless it
was added to the cache by a request with the same canonical ID.

If unspecified or empty, Bazel by default uses the URLs of the file as the
canonical ID. This helps catch the common mistake of updating the URLs without
also updating the hash, resulting in builds that succeed locally but fail on
machines without the file in the cache. This behavior can be disabled with
--repo_env=BAZEL_HTTP_RULES_URLS_AS_DEFAULT_CANONICAL_ID=0.

Expected checksum in Subresource Integrity format of the file downloaded.

This must match the checksum of the file downloaded. _It is a security risk
to omit the checksum as remote files can change._ At best omitting this
field will make your build non-hermetic. It is optional to make development
easier but either this attribute or `sha256` should be set before shipping.

<a href="https://bazel.build/rules/lib/dict">Dictionary: String -> String</a>; optional

<p>

In `WORKSPACE` context only: a dictionary from local repository name to global repository name. This allows controls over workspace dependency resolution for dependencies of this repository.

For example, an entry `"@foo": "@bar"` declares that, for any time this repository depends on `@foo` (such as a dependency on `@foo//some:target`, it should actually resolve that dependency within globally-declared `@bar` (`@bar//some:target`).

This attribute is _not_ supported in `MODULE.bazel` context (when invoking a repository rule inside a module extension's implementation function).

This must match the SHA-256 of the file downloaded. _It is a security risk
to omit the SHA-256 as remote files can change._ At best omitting this
field will make your build non-hermetic. It is optional to make development
easier but either this attribute or `integrity` should be set before shipping.

A URL to a file that will be made available to Bazel.

This must be a file, http or https URL. Redirections are followed.
Authentication is not supported.

More flexibility can be achieved by the urls parameter that allows
to specify alternative URLs to fetch from.

The URL must end in `.jar`.

List of strings; optional

<p>

A list of URLs to a file that will be made available to Bazel.

Each entry must be a file, http or https URL. Redirections are followed.
Authentication is not supported.

URLs are tried in order until one succeeds, so you should list local mirrors first.
If all downloads fail, the rule will fail.

All URLs must end in `.jar`.
