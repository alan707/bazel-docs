## ignore\_directories

```
None ignore_directories(dirs)

The list of directories to ignore in this repository.

This function takes a list of strings and a directory is ignored if any of the given strings matches its repository-relative path according to the semantics of the `glob()` function. This function can be used to ignore directories that are implementation details of source control systems, output files of other build systems, etc.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dirs` | [sequence](../core/list.mdx) of [string](../core/string.mdx)s; required |

## repo

```
None repo(**kwargs)
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `kwargs` | required  The `repo()` function accepts exactly the same arguments as the [`package()`](./reference/be/functions#package) function in BUILD files. |
