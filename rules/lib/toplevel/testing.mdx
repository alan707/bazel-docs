## analysis\_test

```
None testing.analysis_test(name, implementation, attrs={}, fragments=[], toolchains=[], attr_values={})
```

 Creates a new analysis test target.

The number of transitive dependencies of the test are limited. The limit is controlled by `--analysis_testing_deps_limit` flag.


### Parameters

ParameterDescription`name`[string](../core/string.html);
 required

 Name of the target. It should be a Starlark identifier, matching pattern '\[A-Za-z\_\]\[A-Za-z0-9\_\]\*'.
 `implementation`[function](../core/function.html);
 required

 The Starlark function implementing this analysis test. It must have exactly one parameter: [ctx](../builtins/ctx.html). The function is called during the analysis phase. It can access the attributes declared by `attrs` and populated via `attr_values`. The implementation function may not register actions. Instead, it must register a pass/fail result via providing [AnalysisTestResultInfo](../providers/AnalysisTestResultInfo.html).
 `attrs`[dict](../core/dict.html);
 default is `{}`

 Dictionary declaring the attributes. See the [rule](../globals/bzl.html#rule) call. Attributes are allowed to use configuration transitions defined using [analysis\_test\_transition](../globals/bzl.html#analysis_test_transition).
 `fragments`[sequence](../core/list.html) of [string](../core/string.html) s;
 default is `[]`

 List of configuration fragments that are available to the implementation of the analysis test.
 `toolchains`[sequence](../core/list.html);
 default is `[]`

 The set of toolchains the test requires. See the [rule](../globals/bzl.html#rule) call.
 `attr_values`[dict](../core/dict.html) of [string](../core/string.html) s;
 default is `{}`

 Dictionary of attribute values to pass to the implementation.


## ExecutionInfo

```
ExecutionInfo testing.ExecutionInfo
```

 [testing.ExecutionInfo](../providers/ExecutionInfo.html) provider key/constructor



## TestEnvironment

```
RunEnvironmentInfo testing.TestEnvironment(environment, inherited_environment=[])
```

 **Deprecated: Use RunEnvironmentInfo instead.** Creates a new test environment provider. Use this provider to specify extra environment variables to be made available during test execution.


### Parameters

ParameterDescription`environment`[dict](../core/dict.html);
 required

 A map of string keys and values that represent environment variables and their values. These will be made available during the test execution.
 `inherited_environment`[sequence](../core/list.html) of [string](../core/string.html) s;
 default is `[]`

 A sequence of names of environment variables. These variables are made available during the test execution with their current value taken from the shell environment. If a variable is contained in both `environment` and `inherited_environment`, the value inherited from the shell environment will take precedence if set.
