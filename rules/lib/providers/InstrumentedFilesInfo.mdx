# InstrumentedFilesInfo

{% dynamic setvar source_file "src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/starlarkbuildapi/test/InstrumentedFilesInfoApi.java" %}
{% include "\_buttons.html" %}
Contains information about source files and instrumentation metadata files for rule targets matched by [`--instrumentation_filter`](https://bazel.build/reference/command-line-reference#flag--instrumentation_filter) for purposes of [code coverage data collection](https://bazel.build/extending/rules#code_coverage). When coverage data collection is enabled, a manifest containing the combined paths in [`instrumented_files`](#instrumented_files) and [`metadata_files`](#metadata_files) are passed to the test action as inputs, with the manifest's path noted in the environment variable `COVERAGE_MANIFEST`. The metadata files, but not the source files, are also passed to the test action as inputs. When `InstrumentedFilesInfo` is returned by an [aspect](https://bazel.build/extending/aspects)'s implementation function, any `InstrumentedFilesInfo` from the base rule target is ignored.

## instrumented_files

``` rule-signature
depset InstrumentedFilesInfo.instrumented_files
```

[`depset`](../builtins/depset.html) of [`File`](../builtins/File.html) objects representing instrumented source files for this target and its dependencies.

## metadata_files

``` rule-signature
depset InstrumentedFilesInfo.metadata_files
```

[`depset`](../builtins/depset.html) of [`File`](../builtins/File.html) objects representing coverage metadata files for this target and its dependencies. These files contain additional information required to generate LCOV-format coverage output after the code is executed, e.g. the `.gcno` files generated when `gcc` is run with `-ftest-coverage`.
