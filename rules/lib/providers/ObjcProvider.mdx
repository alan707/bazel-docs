## direct_module_maps

``` rule-signature
sequence ObjcProvider.direct_module_maps
```

Module map files from this target directly (no transitive module maps). Used to enforce proper use of private header files and for Swift compilation.

## direct_sources

``` rule-signature
sequence ObjcProvider.direct_sources
```

All direct source files from this target (no transitive files), including any headers in the 'srcs' attribute.

## j2objc_library

``` rule-signature
depset ObjcProvider.j2objc_library
```

Static libraries that are built from J2ObjC-translated Java code.

## module_map

``` rule-signature
depset ObjcProvider.module_map
```

Clang module maps, used to enforce proper use of private header files.

## source

``` rule-signature
depset ObjcProvider.source
```

All transitive source files.

## strict_include

``` rule-signature
depset ObjcProvider.strict_include
```

Non-propagated include search paths specified with '-I' on the command line. Also known as header search paths (and distinct from *user* header search paths).

## umbrella_header

``` rule-signature
depset ObjcProvider.umbrella_header
```

Clang umbrella header. Public headers are \#included in umbrella headers to be compatible with J2ObjC segmented headers.
