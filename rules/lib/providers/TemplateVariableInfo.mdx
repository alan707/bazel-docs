# TemplateVariableInfo

{% dynamic setvar source_file "src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/starlarkbuildapi/TemplateVariableInfoApi.java" %}
{% include "\_buttons.html" %}
Encapsulates template variables, that is, variables that can be referenced by strings like `$(VARIABLE)` in BUILD files and expanded by `ctx.expand_make_variables` and implicitly in certain attributes of built-in rules.

`TemplateVariableInfo` can be created by calling its eponymous constructor with a string-to-string dict as an argument that specifies the variables provided.

Example: `platform_common.TemplateVariableInfo({'FOO': 'bar'})`
